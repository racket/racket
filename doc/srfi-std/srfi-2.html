<H1>Abstract</H1>

<P>Like an ordinary AND, an AND-LET* special form evaluates its arguments --
expressions -- one after another in order, till the first one that
yields #f. Unlike AND, however, a non-#f result of one expression can
be bound to a fresh variable and used in the subsequent expressions.
AND-LET* is a cross-breed between LET* and AND.

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<P>In case of an ordinary AND formed of proper boolean expressions:<BR>
(AND E1 E2 ...)<BR>
expression E2, if it gets to be evaluated, knows that E1 has returned
non-#f. Moreover, E2 knows exactly what the result of E1 was -- #t --
which E2 can use to its advantage. If E1 however is an extended
boolean expression, E2 can no longer tell which particular non-#f
value E1 has returned. Chances are it took a lot of work to evaluate
E1, and the produced result (a number, a vector, a string, etc) may be
of value to E2. Alas, the AND form merely checks that the result is
not an #f, and throws it away. If E2 needs it, it has to compute that
value anew. This proposed AND-LET* special form lets constituent
expressions get hold of the results of already evaluated expressions,
without re-doing their work.

<P>AND-LET* can be thought of as a combination of LET* and AND, or a
generalization of COND's send operator =&gt;. An AND-LET* form can also be
considered a sequence of guarded expressions. In a regular program,
forms may produce results, bind them to variables and let other forms
use these results. AND-LET* differs in that it checks to make sure that
every produced result "makes sense" (that is, not an #f). The first
"failure" triggers the guard and aborts the rest of the sequence
(which presumably would not make any sense to execute anyway).

Examples:
<PRE>
(AND-LET* ((my-list (compute-list)) ((not (null? my-list))))
          (do-something my-list))

(define (look-up key alist)
  (and-let* ((x (assq key alist))) (cdr x)))

(or
  (and-let* ((c (read-char))
    ((not (eof-object? c))))
    (string-set! some-str i c)  
    (set! i (+ 1 i)))
  (begin (do-process-eof)))

			; A more realistic example
                        ; Parse the 'timestamp' ::= 'token1' 'token2'
                        ;   token1 ::= 'YY' 'MM' 'J'
                        ;   token2 ::= 'GG' 'gg' "/"
(define (parse-full-timestamp token1 token2)
  (AND-LET* (((= 5 (string-length token1)))
             ((= 5 (string-length token2)))
             (timestamp
               (OS:string-&gt;time "%m/%d/%y %H:%M"
                 (string
                   (string-ref token1 2) (string-ref token1 3) #\/
                   (string-ref token1 0) (string-ref token1 1) #\/
                   (case (string-ref token1 4)
                     ((#\8 #\9) #\9) (else #\0))
                   (string-ref token1 4) #\space
                   (string-ref token2 0) (string-ref token2 1) #\:
                   (string-ref token2 2) (string-ref token2 3))))
             ((positive? timestamp)))
           timestamp))
</PRE>

<P>
AND-LET* is also similar to an "anaphoric AND" LISP macro [Rob Warnock,
comp.lang.scheme, 26 Feb 1998 09:06:43 GMT, Message-ID:
6d3bb3$3804h@fido.asd.sgi.com]. AND-LET* allows however more than one
intermediate result, each of which continues to be bound through the
rest of the form.


<H1>Specification</H1>

<H2><a name="and-let">Syntax and Informal Semantics</a></H2>

<PRE>
AND-LET* (CLAWS) BODY

CLAWS ::= '() | (cons CLAW CLAWS)
CLAW  ::=  (VARIABLE EXPRESSION) | (EXPRESSION) |
           BOUND-VARIABLE
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>The CLAWS are evaluated in the strict left-to-right order
<LI>For each CLAW, the EXPRESSION part is evaluated first (or BOUND-VARIABLE is looked up)
<LI>If the result is #f, AND-LET* immediately returns #f
<LI>Otherwise, if  the CLAW is of the form (VARIABLE EXPRESSION)
the EXPRESSION's value is bound to a freshly made VARIABLE
<LI>The VARIABLE is available for the rest of the CLAWS , and the BODY
<LI>As usual, all VARIABLEs must be unique (like in let*)
</UL>

<H2>Formal (Denotational) Semantics</H2>

<PRE>
eval[ (AND-LET* (CLAW1 ...) BODY), env] =
   eval_claw[ CLAW1, env ] andalso
   eval[ (AND-LET* ( ...) BODY), ext_claw_env[CLAW1, env]]

eval[ (AND-LET* (CLAW) ), env] = eval_claw[ CLAW, env ]
eval[ (AND-LET* () FORM1 ...), env] = eval[ (BEGIN FORM1 ...), env ]
eval[ (AND-LET* () ), env] = #t

eval_claw[ BOUND-VARIABLE, env ] =
   eval[ BOUND-VARIABLE, env ]
eval_claw[ (EXPRESSION), env ] =
   eval[ EXPRESSION, env ]
eval_claw[ (VARIABLE EXPRESSION), env ] =
   eval[ EXPRESSION, env ]

ext_claw_env[ BOUND-VARIABLE, env ] = env
ext_claw_env[ (EXPRESSION), env ] =
   env-after-eval[ EXPRESSION, env ]
ext_claw_env[ (VARIABLE EXPRESSION), env ] =
   extend-env[ env-after-eval[ EXPRESSION, env ],
              VARIABLE boundto eval[ EXPRESSION, env ]]
</PRE>

<H1>Implementation</H1>

<P>The full implementation plus the validation code are available <A href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-2/vland-gambit.scm">here</A> (which is a copy of
<A href="http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Scheme/vland.scm">
http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Scheme/vland.scm</A>).

<P>This is an implementation of AND-LET* as a (Gambit) low-level macro that
re-writes AND-LET* as a "tree" of AND and LET forms. A validation code is
also presented, which verifies not only that everything works as
expected, but also that AND-LET* finds syntax errors where expected.
