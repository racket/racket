The _dynext_ collection provides three libraries --- compile.ss,
link.ss, and file.ss --- for communicating with a platform-specific C
compiler and linker.

_compile.ss_
------------

> (compile-extension quiet? input-file output-file includes)
   quiet? - Boolean indicating whether command should be echoed to stdout
   input-file - A C source path/string
   output-file - A compiled object path/string
   includes - A list of include directory paths/strings; MzScheme's
              include is added automatically.

Compilation is controlled by a number of parameters for Windows
and Unix:

>  current-extension-compiler - compiler executable path/string or
    #f. The default is set by searching for an executable using the
    PATH environment variable. Under windows, the search looks for
    cl.exe, then gcc.exe, then bcc32.exe (Borland). Under Unix, it
    checks the MZSCHEME_DYNEXT_COMPILER environment variable, then
    looks for gcc, then cc. #f indicates that no compiler could be
    found.

>  current-extension-compiler-flags - list of paths/strings and thunks
    (see `expand-for-compile-variant' below) for strings passed to the
    compiler as flags. Under Windows, the default is (list "/c" "/O2"
    3m-flag-thunk) for cl.exe and (list "-c" "-O2" 3m-flag-thunk) for
    gcc.exe and bcc32.exe, where 3m-flag-thunk returns (list
    "-DMZ_PRECISE_GC") for the '3m variant and null for any other
    variant; under Unix, (list "-c" "-O2" 3m-flag-thunk).

>  current-make-compile-include-strings - procedure that takes an
    include directory path/string and returns a list of strings for
    the command line.  Windows: "dir" -> (list "/Idir") for cl.exe,
    (list "-Idir") for gcc.exe and bcc32.exe; Unix: "dir" -> (list
    "-Idir")

>  current-make-compile-input-strings - procedure that takes an
    input file path/string and returns a list of strings for the
    command line.  The default is `list'.

>  current-make-compile-output-strings - procedure that takes an
    output file path/string and returns a list of strings for the
    command line.  Windows: "file" -> (list "/Fofile") for cl.exe,
    (list "-o" "file") for gcc.exe and bcc32.exe; Unix: "file" ->
    (list "-o" "file")

>  compile-variant - a symbol, either 'normal or '3m, that indicates the
    target for compilation.

Helper functions:

> (use-standard-compiler name) sets the above parameters for a
    particular known compiler. The acceptable names are 
    platforms-specific:
      Unix: 'cc or 'gcc
      Windows: 'gcc, 'msvc, or 'borland
      MacOS: 'cw

> (get-standard-compilers) returns a list of standard compiler
    names for the current platform.

> (expand-for-compile-variant l) takes a list of paths/strings and
    thunks and returns a list of strings. Each thunk in the input list
    is applied to get a list of strings that is inlined in the
    corresponding position in the output list. This expansion enables
    occasional parameterization of flag lists, etc., depending on the
    current compile variant.

Under MacOS, none of these options are used. The compiler always
uses CodeWarrior if it can be found and the compilation options
cannot be changed.

The unit/sig form defined by _compiler.ss_ (signature in
_compiles.ss_) requires no imports.

_link.ss_
---------

> (link-extension quiet? input-files output-file)
   quiet? - Boolean indicating whether command should be echoed to stdout
   input-files - A list of compiled object filename paths/strings
   output-file - An extension filename path/string

   For Windows, a special linking sequence is initiated if the
   linker's name is ld.exe (for gcc).

Linking parameters:

>  current-extension-linker - linker executable path/string or #f. 
     The default is set by searching for an executable using the PATH
     environment variable. Under Windows, it looks for cl.exe, then
     ld.exe (gcc), then ilink32.exe (Borland). Under Unix it checks
     the MZSCHEME_DYNEXT_LINKER environment variable, then, except
     AIX, it looks for ld. Under AIX, it looks for cc. #f indicates
     that no linker could be found.

>  current-extension-linker-flags - list of paths/strings and thunks
     (see `expand-for-link-variant' below). Under Windows, default is
     (list "/LD") for cl.exe, (list "--dll") for ld.exe, (list "/Tpd"
     "/c") for ilink32.exe.  Under Unix, the default varies greatly
     among platforms.

>  current-make-link-input-strings - procedure that takes an
     input file path/string and returns a list of strings for the
     command line.  The default is `list'.

>  current-make-link-output-strings - procedure that takes an output
     file path/string and returns a list of strings for the command
     line.  Windows: "file" -> (list "/Fefile") for cl.exe, something
     like (list "-e" "_dll_entry@12" "-o" "file") for ld.exe,
     something complex for ilink32.exe; Unix: "file" -> (list "-o"
     "file")

>  current-standard-link-libraries - a list of paths/strings and thunks
     (see `expand-for-link-variant' below) for file paths to be linked
     with all supplied files.  For most platforms, the default is
        (list (build-path (collection-path "mzscheme" "lib") 
                          (system-library-subpath)
                          mzdyn-thunk))
     where mzdyn-thunk produces (list "mzdyn.o") for the 'normal
     variant and (list "mzdyn3m.o") for the '3m variant (also see
     `current-use-mzdyn').

>  current-use-mzdyn - whether the default standard link libraries
      include the mzdyn library.  Defaults to #t.

>  link-variant - a symbol, either 'normal or '3m, that indicates the
    target for linking.

Helper functions:

>  (use-standard-linker name) sets the above parameters for a
     particular known linker. The acceptable names are
     platforms-specific, the same as for use-standard-compiler.

> (expand-for-link-variant l) is the same as
    `expand-for-compile-variant' (see above).

Under MacOS, none of these options are used. The linker always uses
CodeWarrior if it can be found and the linking options cannot be
changed.

The unit/sig form defined by _linkr.ss_ (signature in _links.ss_)
requires no imports.

_file.ss_
---------

> (append-zo-suffix s) - appends the .zo file suffix to the
  path/string s, returning a path.

> (append-object-suffix s) - appends the platform-standard compiled
   object file suffix to the path/string s, returning a path.

> (append-c-suffix s) - appends the platform-standard C source
   file suffix to the path/string s, returning a path.

> (append-constant-pool-suffix s) - appends the constant pool file
   suffix (.kp) to the path/string s, returning a path.

> (append-extension-suffix s) - appends the platform-standard dynamic
   extension file suffix to the path/string s, returning a path.

> (extract-base-filename/ss s program) - strips the Scheme file suffix
   from the path/string s and returns a stripped path. If s is not a
   Scheme file name and `program' is a symbol, and error is signalled.
   If s is not a Scheme file and `program' is #f, #f is returned. The
   `program' argument is optional and defaults to #f.

> (extract-base-filename/c s program) - same as
   extract-base-filename/ss, but for C source files.

> (extract-base-filename/kp s program) - same as
   extract-base-filename/ss, but for constant pool files.

> (extract-base-filename/o s program) - same as
   extract-base-filename/ss, but for compiled object files.

> (extract-base-filename/ext s program) - same as
   extract-base-filename/ss, but for extension files.
