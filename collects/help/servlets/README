When the doc/help subcollection is installed, the installer creates
an hdindex file.  See plt/collects/help/doc.txt for information about
the structure of such files.

To create index entries for Help Desk servlets, put 
anchor entries of the form

  (A ((NAME "name") (VALUE "Index entry")))

on a single line in the Scheme source.  The NAME attribute
can be any string that is unique among such anchors in that
file, though of course it should be mnemonic.  The VALUE
attribute is used as the index entry that is matched against 
search strings in Help Desk, and appears again as the 
link caption in the Help Desk search results.
