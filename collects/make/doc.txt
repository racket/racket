_Overview of make_
------------------

This library provides a Scheme version of the standard Unix
`make' utility. Its syntax is intended to simulate regular
Unix make in Scheme.

If you are already familiar with make, skip down the precise
details of the make collection. This section contains a
brief overview of make. The idea is to explain how to
generate some project you have from a collection of source
files that go through several stages of processing.

For example, lets say that you are writing some project that
has three input files (that you create and maintain) called
a.input, b.input, and c.input. Further, there are two stages
of processing -- first you run a particular tool
"make-output" that takes an input file and produces and
output file, and second you combine the input files into a
single file using "output". Using make, you might write
this:

a.output: a.input
	make-output a.input a.output
b.output: b.input
	make-output b.input b.output
c.output: c.input
	make-output c.input c.output 
total: a.output b.output c.output
	combine a.output b.output c.output 

Once you've put those above lines in a file called
"Makefile", you can issue the command:

  make total 

that builds your entire project. The Makefile consists of
several lines that tell `make' how to create each piece. The
first two lines say that a.output depends on a.input and the
command for making a.output from a.input is 

  make-output a.input a.output

The point of this exercise is that the `make' utility looks
at the file creation dates of the various files and only
re-builds what is necessary.  Make is based on building
things with shell programs. If, on the other hand, you want
to build similar things with various Scheme programs, you
can use the make collection.

Here's the equivalent Scheme program: 

(require (lib "make.ss" "make"))

(define (make-output in out)
   ...)

(define (combine-total . args)
  ...)

(make
  (("a.output" ("a.input") (make-output "a.output" "a.input"))
   ("b.output" ("b.input") (make-output "b.output" "b.input"))
   ("c.output" ("c.input") (make-output "c.output" "c.input"))
   ("total" ("a.output" "b.output" "c.output")
            (combine-total "a.output" "b.output" "c.output")))

If you were to fill in the ellipses above with calls to
`system', you'd have the exact same thing as the original
Makefile. In addition, if you use `make/proc', you can
abstract over the various make lines (for example, the
a.output, b.output, and c.output lines are very similar and
it would be good to write a program to generate those
lines).
			      
_make.ss_
---------

The make.ss library in the `make' collection provides a
`make' macro and a `make/proc' procedure.

> (make ((target (depend ...) command ...) ...) argv)

expands to

  (make/proc
    (list (list target (list depend ...) (lambda () command ...)) ...)
    argv)

> (make/proc spec argv) performs a make according to `spec'
and using `argv' as command-line arguments selecting one
or more targets.  `argv' can either be a string or a
vector of strings.

`spec' is a MAKE-SPEC:

  MAKE-SPEC = (list-of MAKE-LINE)
  MAKE-LINE = (list TARGET (list-of DEPEND-STRING) COMMAND-THUNK)
  TARGET = (union string (list-of string)) ; either a string or a list of strings
  DEPEND-STRING = string
  COMMAND-THUNK = (-> void)

To make a target, make/proc is first called on each of the
target's dependencies. If a target is not in the spec and it
exists, then the target is considered made. If a target is
older than any of its dependencies, the corresponding
COMMAND-THUNK is invoked. The COMMAND-THUNK is optional; a
MAKE-LINE without a COMMAND-THUNK is useful as a target for
making a number of other targets (the dependencies).

`make/proc' catches any exceptions raised by a COMMAND-THUNK
and wraps them in an exn:fail:make structure, and raises the
wrapped exn. exn:fail:make structures are defined with:

  (define-struct (exn:fail:make exn:fail) (target orig-exn))

The `target' field is a string or a list of strings naming
the target(s), and the `orig-exn' field is the original
exception.

make.ss also provides the following parameters:

> (make-print-checking [on?]) - If #f, make only prints when
it is making a target. Otherwise, it prints when it is
checking the dependencies of a target. Default: #t.

> (make-print-dep-no-line [on?]) - If #f, make only prints
"checking..."  lines for dependencies that have a
corresponding make line.  Default: #f.

> (make-print-reasons [on?]) If #t, make prints the reason
for each dependency that fires. Default: #t.

The make-sig.ss library provides `make^' signature that includes all
of the above.

The make-unit.ss library provides a `make@' unit with no imports and the
single export `make^'.

_collection.ss_
---------------

 [index entry: _collections, compiling_]

The collection.ss library in the make collection provides a
`make-collection' procedure.

> (make-collection collection-name collection-files argv) constructs
and performs a make to compile a collection of Scheme files into a
multi-file extension. `collection-name' is used as a name that is
embedded into publicly visible names in the extension (choosing a
unique `collection-name' for each extension helps avoid conflicts
among different extensions for certain operating
systems). `collection-files' is a list of Scheme source files to be
compiled. `argv' is passed on to `make'.

The resulting extension "_loader" is compiled to the current
directory's "compiled/native/PLATFORM" subdirectory, where `PLATFORM'
is replaced by the system name of the current platform. Intermediate
.c and .kp files are placed into "compiled/native", and intermediate
object files are also placed into "compiled/native/PLATFORM".  The .c
and .kp files are preserved so that they can be generated once for
compiling across multiple platforms with the same filesystem.

Make rules are also generated for compiling .zo files, placed in the
"compiled" directory. The make target "zo" makes all of the .zo
files. (In other words, pass #("zo") as `argv' to compile .zo files.)

The "compiled", "compiled/native", etc. directories are automatically
created if they do not already exist. Currently, `make-collection'
does not try to infer sophisticated file dependencies. Each .c/.kp/.zo
is dependent just on the .ss source file, each object file is depend
only on its .c file, and the extension is dependent only on the
object files.

_setup-extension.ss_
--------------------

 [index entry: _Setup PLT compile extension_]

The "setup-extension.ss" library helps compile C code via Setup PLT's
"pre-install" phase (triggered by a `pre-installer' item in "info.ss";
see the "setup" collection for further information).

The `pre-install' function takes a number of arguments that describe
how the C code is compiled, mainly the libraries that it depends
on. It then drives a C compiler via the "dynext" collection functions.

Many issues can complicate C compilation, and the `pre-install'
function helps with a few:

   * finding non-standard libraries and header files,

   * taming to some degree the differing conventions of Unix and
     Windows, 

   * setting up suitable dependencies on MzScheme headers, and

   * using a pre-compiled binary when a "precompiled" directory
     is present.

Many extension installers will have to sort out addition platform
issues manually, however. For example, an old "readline" installer
used to pick whether to link to "libcurses" or "libncurses"
heuristically by inspecting "/usr/lib". More generally, the "last
chance" argument to `pre-install' allows an installer to patch
compiler and linker options (see "dynext") before the C code is
compiled or linked.


> (pre-install plthome-dir
               collection-dir
               file.c
               default-lib-dir
               include-subdirs
               find-unix-libs
               find-windows-libs
               unix-libs
               windows-libs
	       extra-depends
               last-chance-k
               [3m-too? #f])

The arguments are as follows:

  * plthome-dir --- the directory provided to a `pre-installer'
    function.

  * collection-dir --- a directory to use as the current directory
    while building.

  * file.c --- the name of the source file (relative to
    `collection-dir'). The output file will be the same, except with a
    ".c" suffix replaced with ".so" or ".dll" (depending on the
    platform) and the path changed to "compiled/native/<platform>".

    If "precompiled/native/<platform>/file.{so,dll} exists", then
    `file.c' is not used at all, and the file in the "precompiled"
    directory is simply copied.

  * default-lib-dir --- a default directory for finding supporting
    libraries, often a subdirectory of `collection-dir'. The user
    can supplement this path by setting the PLT_EXTENSION_LIB_PATHS
    environment variable. [Index entry: _PLT_EXTENSION_LIB_PATHS_]
    This one environment variable applies to all extensions manged
    by `pre-install'.

  * include-subdirs --- a list of relative paths in which include
    files will be found; the path of the path will be determined
    through a search, in case it's not in a standard place like
    /usr/include.

    For example, the list is '("openssl") for the "openssl"
    collection, because the source uses "#include <openssl/ssl.h>" and
    "#include <openssl/err.h>".

  * find-unix-libs --- like `include-subdirs', but a list of library
    bases. Leave off the "lib" prefix and any suffix (such as ".a" or
    ".zo"). For "openssl", the list is '("ssl" "crypto"). This name
    will get a "-l" prefix on the link line.

  * find-windows-libs --- like `find-unix-libs', but for Windows.  The
    library name will be suffixed with ".lib" and supplied directly to
    the linker.

  * unix-libs --- like `find-unix-libs', except that the installer
    makes no attempt to find the libraries in a non-standard
    place. For example, the "readline" installer supplies '("curses").

  * windows-libs --- like `unix-libs', but for Windows. For example,
    the "openssl" installer supplies '("wsock32").

  * extra-depends --- a list of relative paths to treat as
    dependencies for compiling `file.c'. Often this list will include
    `file.c' with the ".c" suffix replaced by ".ss" or ".scm". For
    example, the "openssl" installer supplies '("mzssl.ss") to ensure
    that the stub module "mzssl.ss" is never used when the true
    extension can be built.

  * last-chance-k --- a procedure of one argument, which is a thunk.
    this procedure should invoke the thunk to make the file, but may
    add parameterizations before the final build. For example, the
    "readline" installer adds an AIX-specific compile flag in this
    step when under AIX.

  * 3m-too?--- a boolean. If true, when the 3m variant is installed,
    use the equivalent to mzc --xform to transform the source file and
    then compile and link for 3m. Otherwise, the extension is built
    only for CGC when the CGC variant is installed.
