This file contains "properties" of various files and directories in the Racket
tree.  Its format is briefly described below, but it is mainly intended to be
used as a command-line script -- run it with `-h' to find out how to use it.
In addition, you can make it work as a git command -- put this in a file
called "git-prop" somewhere in your path (make sure to "chmod +x" it):

  #!/bin/sh
  top="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" || exit 1
  exec "$top/collects/meta/props" "$@"

and use it as a git command: `git prop cmd args...'.  This will use the script
from the work tree that you're now in, with any racket executable that happens
to be on your $PATH.  This is fine, because the script reads and writes itself,
unelated to the racket version that runs it.

As described above, the format of this file makes it easy to edit manually, but
it should be considered internal and mostly manipulated by running it as a
script.  Specifically, when the script updates the contents, it will write
things in a certain way regardless of how it was when the file was read in.

The data is contained in a specially marked comment.  Its format is a
sequence of path and properties for it:

  <path> <prop> <val> <prop> <val> ...

where <path> is a "/"-delimited string (relative to the racket root), <prop>
is one of a few known property symbols, and <val> is the assigned value.  The
value is should follow the predicate specification for the property, which is
defined as `known-props' before the properties data block; note that it is
assumed that the data in this file is all valid, so take care if you edit it
manually.  Properties of a directory apply to all sub-paths in it (but this
might not be the case for future properties).  A property can overwrite a
previous value that was already set, which means that if you really want to set
properties manually, you can just an appropriate line at the end but note that
the data is expected to have the correct format (it is checked when properties
are set by running this file as a script).

Requiring this file builds the data table and provides an interface for
properties, intended to be used by meta tools.  In these functions, `path' is a
path argument that is given as a "/"-delimited and normalized path
string (no ".", "..", "//", or a "/" suffix) relative to the racket root, and
path/s is either such a string or a list of them.

* (get-prop path/s prop [default]
            #:strict? [strict? #f] #:as-string? [as-string? #f])

  Returns the property value of a given path.  The `default' argument is used
  similarly to `hash-ref' (can be a thunk, a value, or if not specified an
  exception is raised).  If `strict?' is true, then the property value of the
  path itself is returned, not inheriting values from parent paths.  If
  `as-string?' is true, then the string form of the property is returned (but
  note that if there is no property value, the default is used as is in either
  case).  See the known-props for how properties translate to/from strings.

* (set-prop! path/s prop value
             #:warn? [warn? #t] #:as-string? [as-string? #f])

  Sets the value of a (known) proprty for a given path or paths.  If `warn?' is
  true, an exception is raised if the property is already set to the value for
  the (any) path.  If `as-string?' is true, then the input `value' is expected
  to be a string that will be parsed according to the property's spec (and
  verified in the process) -- otherwise the value is used as is with no
  verification.

  Note that this function does not rewrite the file, use `write-props' for
  that.

* (del-prop! path/s prop #:warn? [warn? #t])

  Similar to `set-prop!', except that it removes a property from the given
  path (or paths).  The property is removed from the path itself, so this will
  have no effect if a parent path has a value.  If `warn?' is true, an
  exception is raised if the property is not directly set for path.

* (write-props)

  Writes all properties back into *this* file.  The properties are normalized:
  paths and properties are sorted, redundant entries are removed.  This
  minimizes the data (in case the file is edited manually), and minimizes
  changes to the file when it is modified.
