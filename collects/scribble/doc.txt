(The rest of the Scribble documentation is now a separate manual.)

The Scribble Reader
-------------------

The Scribble @-reader is designed to be a convenient facility for
using free-form text in Scheme code, where "@" is chosen as one of
the least-used characters in Scheme code.

You can use the reader via Racket's `#reader' form:

  #reader(lib "reader.ss" "scribble")@{This is free-form text!}

Note that the reader will only read @-forms as S-expressions.  The
meaning of these S-expressions depends on the rest of your own code.

A PLT Scheme manual more likely starts with

  #reader(lib "docreader.ss" "scribble")

which installs a reader, wraps the file content afterward into a
Racket module, and parses the body into a document using
"decode.ss".

Another way to use the reader is to use the `use-at-readtable'
function to switch the current readtable to a readtable that parses
@-forms.  You can do this in a single command line:

  mzscheme -ile scribble/reader "(use-at-readtable)"

*** Concrete Syntax

Informally, the concrete syntax of @-forms is

  "@" <cmd> "[" <datum> ... "]" "{" <text-body> ... "}"

where all three parts after "@" are optional, but at least one should
be present.  (Note that spaces are not allowed between the three
parts.)  "@" is set as a non-terminating reader macro, so it can be
used as usual in Scheme identifiers unless you want to use it as a
first character of an identifier; in this case you need to quote with
a backslash (`\@foo') or quote the whole identifier with bars
(`|@foo|').

  (define |@foo| '\@bar@baz)

Of course, "@" is not treated specially in Scheme strings, character
constants, etc.

Roughly, a form matching the above grammar is read as

  (<cmd> <datum> ... <parsed-body> ...)

where <parsed-body> is the translation of each <text-body> in the
input.  Thus, the initial <cmd> determines the Scheme code that the
input is translated into.  The common case is when <cmd> is a Scheme
identifier, which generates a plain Scheme form.

A <text-body> is made of text, newlines, and nested @-forms.  Note
that the syntax for @-forms is the same in a <text-body> context as in
a Scheme context.  A <text-body> that isn't an @-form is converted to
a string expression for its <parsed-body>, and newlines are converted
to "\n" expressions.

  @foo{bar baz
       blah}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "bar baz" "\n" "blah")

  @foo{bar @baz[3]
       blah}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "bar " (baz 3) "\n" "blah")

  @foo{bar @baz{3}
       blah}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "bar " (baz "3") "\n" "blah")

  @foo{bar @baz[2 3]{4 5}
       blah}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "bar " (baz 2 3 "4 5") "\n" "blah")

Note that spaces are not allowed before a "[" or a "{", or they will
be part of the following text (or Scheme code).  (More on using braces
in body texts below.)

  @foo{bar @baz[2 3] {4 5}}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "bar " (baz 2 3) " {4 5}")

When the above @-forms appear in a Scheme expression context, the
lexical environment must provide bindings for `foo' (as a procedure or
a macro).

  (let* ([formatter (lambda (fmt)
          (lambda args (format fmt (apply string-append args))))]
         [bf (formatter "*~a*")]
         [it (formatter "/~a/")]
         [ul (formatter "_~a_")]
         [text string-append])
    @text{@it{Note}: @bf{This is @ul{not} a pipe}.})
  -->  "/Note/: *This is _not_ a pipe*."

If you want to see the expression that is actually being read, you can
use Scheme's `quote'.

  '@foo{bar}

** The Command Part

Besides being a Scheme identifier, the <cmd> part of an @-form can
have Scheme punctuation prefixes, which will end up wrapping the
*whole* expression.

  @`',@foo{blah}    --reads-as-->    `',@(foo "blah")

When writing Scheme code, this means that @`',@foo{blah} is exactly
the same as `@',@foo{blah} and `',@@foo{blah}, but unlike the latter
two, the first construct can appear in body texts with the same
meaning, whereas the other two would not work (see below).

After the optional punctuation prefix, the <cmd> itself is not limited
to identifiers; it can be *any* Scheme expression.

  @(lambda (x) x){blah}    --reads-as-->    ((lambda (x) x) "blah")
  @`(unquote foo){blah}    --reads-as-->    `(,foo "blah")

In addition, the command can be omitted altogether, which will omit it
from the translation, resulting in an S-expression that usually
contains, say, just strings:

  @{foo bar     --reads-as-->    ("foo bar" "\n" "baz")
    baz}

  @'{foo bar    --reads-as-->    '("foo bar" "\n" "baz")
     baz}

If the command part begins with a ";" (with no newline between the "@"
and the ";"), then the construct is a comment.  There are two comment
forms, one for arbitrary-text and possibly nested comments, and
another one for line comments:

  @;{<anything> ...}

  @;<anything-else-without-newline>

In the first form, the commented body must still parse correctly; see
the description of the body syntax below.  In the second form, all
text from the "@;" to the end of the line *and* all following spaces
(or tabs) are part of the comment (similar to "%" comments in TeX).

  @foo{bar @; comment    --reads-as-->    (foo "bar bazblah")
       baz@;
       blah}

Tip: if you're editing in a Scheme-aware editor (like DrRacket or
Emacs), it is useful to comment out blocks like this:

  @;{
    ...
  ;}

so the editor does not treat the file as having unbalanced
parenthesis.

If only the <cmd> part of an @-form is specified, then the result is
the command part only, without an extra set of parenthesis.  This
makes it suitable for Scheme escapes in body texts.  (More on this
below, in the description of the body part.)

  @foo{x @y z}          --reads-as-->    (foo "x " y " z")
  @foo{x @(* y 2) z}    --reads-as-->    (foo "x " (* y 2) " z")
  @{@foo bar}           --reads-as-->    (foo " bar")

Finally, note that there are currently no special rules for using "@"
in the command itself, which can lead to things like:

  @@foo{bar}{baz}    --reads-as-->    ((foo "bar") "baz")

** The Datum Part

The datum part can contains arbitrary Scheme expressions, which are
simply stacked before the body text arguments:

  @foo[1 (* 2 3)]{bar}     --reads-as-->    (foo 1 (* 2 3) "bar")
  @foo[@bar{...}]{blah}    --reads-as-->    (foo (bar "...") "blah")

The body part can still be omitted, which is essentially an
alternative syntax for plain (non-textual) S-expressions:

  @foo[bar]              --reads-as-->    (foo bar)
  @foo{bar @f[x] baz}    --reads-as-->    (foo "bar " (f x) " baz")

The datum part can be empty, which makes no difference, except when
the body is omitted.  It is more common, however, to use an empty body
for the same purpose.

  @foo[]{bar}    --reads-as-->    (foo "bar")
  @foo[]         --reads-as-->    (foo)
  @foo           --reads-as-->    foo
  @foo{}         --reads-as-->    (foo)

The most common use of the datum part is for Scheme forms that expect
keyword-value arguments that precede the body of text arguments.

  @foo[#:style 'big]{bar}    --reads-as-->    (foo #:style 'big "bar")

** The Body Part

The syntax of the body part is intended to be as convenient as
possible for free text.  It can contain almost any text -- the only
characters with special meaning is "@" for sub-@-forms, and "}" for
the end of the text.  In addition, a "{" is allowed as part of the
text, and it makes the matching "}" be part of the text too -- so
balanced braces are valid text.

  @foo{f{o}o}     --reads-as-->    (foo "f{o}o")
  @foo{{{}}{}}    --reads-as-->    (foo "{{}}{}")

As described above, the text turns to a sequence of string arguments
for the resulting form.  Spaces at the beginning and end of lines are
discarded, and newlines turn to individual "\n" strings (i.e., they
are not merged with other body parts).  (See also the information
about newlines and indentation below.)  Spaces are *not* discarded if
they appear after the open "{" (before the closing "}") when there is
also text that follows (precedes) it; specifically, they are preserved
in a single-line body.

  @foo{bar}         --reads-as-->    (foo "bar")
  @foo{ bar }       --reads-as-->    (foo " bar ")
  @foo[1]{ bar }    --reads-as-->    (foo 1 " bar ")

If "@" appears in a body, then it is interpreted as Scheme code, which
means that the @-reader is applied recursively, and the resulting
syntax appears as part of the S-expression, among other string
contents.

  @foo{a @bar{b} c}    --reads-as-->    (foo "a " (bar "b") " c")

If the nested "@" construct has only a command -- no body or datum
parts -- it will not appear in a subform.  Given that the command part
can be any Scheme expression, this makes "@" a general escape to
arbitrary Scheme code.

  @foo{a @bar c}        --reads-as-->    (foo "a " bar " c")
  @foo{a @(bar 2) c}    --reads-as-->    (foo "a " (bar 2) " c")

This is particularly useful with strings, which can be used to include
arbitrary text.

  @foo{A @"}" marks the end}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "A } marks the end")

Note that the escaped string is (intentionally) merged with the rest
of the text.  This works for "@" too:

  @foo{The prefix: @"@".}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "The prefix: @.")

  @foo{@"@x{y}" --> (x "y")}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "@x{y} --> (x \"y\")")

* Alternative Body Syntax

In addition to the above, there is an alternative syntax for the body,
one that specifies a new marker for its end: use "|{" for the opening
marker to have the text terminated by a "}|".

  @foo|{...}|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "...")

  @foo|{"}" follows "{"}|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "\"}\" follows \"{\"")

  @foo|{Nesting |{is}| ok}|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "Nesting |{is}| ok")

This applies to sub-@-forms too -- the "@" must be prefixed with a
"|":

  @foo|{Maze
        |@bar{is}
        Life!}|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "Maze" "\n" (bar "is") "Life!")

  @t|{In |@i|{sub|@"@"s}| too}|
  --reads-as-->
  (t "In " (i "sub@s") " too")

Note that the subform uses its own delimiters, "{...}" or "|{...}|".
This means that you can copy and paste Scribble text with @-forms
freely, just prefix the "@" if the immediate surrounding text has a
prefix.

For even better control, you can add characters in the opening
delimiter, between the "|" and the "{".  Characters that are put there
(non alphanumeric ASCII characters only, excluding "{" and "@") should
also be used for sub-@-forms, and the end-of-body marker should have
these characters in reverse order with paren-like characters ("(",
"[", "<") mirrored.

  @foo|<<<{@x{foo} |@{bar}|.}>>>|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "@x{foo} |@{bar}|.")

  @foo|!!{X |!!@b{Y}...}!!|
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "X " (b "Y") "...")

Finally, remember that you can use an expression escape with a Scheme
string for confusing situations.  This works well when you only need
to quote short pieces, and the above works well when you have larger
multi-line body texts.

* Scheme Expression Escapes

In some cases, you may want to use a Scheme identifier (or a number or
a boolean etc.) in a position that touches the following text; in
these situations you should surround the escaped Scheme expression by
a pair of "|" characters.  The text inside the bars is parsed as a
Scheme expression.

  @foo{foo@bar.}      --reads-as-->    (foo "foo" bar.)
  @foo{foo@|bar|.}    --reads-as-->    (foo "foo" bar ".")
  @foo{foo@3.}        --reads-as-->    (foo "foo" 3.0)
  @foo{foo@|3|.}      --reads-as-->    (foo "foo" 3 ".")

This form is a generic Scheme expression escape, there is no body text
or datum part when you use this form.

  @foo{foo@|(f 1)|{bar}}    --reads-as-->   (foo "foo" (f 1) "{bar}")
  @foo{foo@|bar|[1]{baz}}   --reads-as-->   (foo "foo" bar "[1]{baz}")

This works for string expressions too, but note that unlike the above,
the string is (intentionally) not merged with the rest of the text:

  @foo{x@"y"z}      --reads-as-->    (foo "xyz")
  @foo{x@|"y"|z}    --reads-as-->    (foo "x" "y" "z")

Expression escapes also work with *any* number of expressions,

  @foo{x@|1 (+ 2 3) 4|y}    --reads-as-->    (foo "x" 1 (+ 2 3) 4 "y")

  @foo{x@|*                 --reads-as-->    (foo "x" * * "y")
          *|y}

It seems that "@||" has no purpose -- but remember that these escapes
are never merged with the surrounding text, which can be useful when
you want to control the sub expressions in the form.

  @foo{Alice@||Bob@|    --reads-as-->    (foo "Alice" "Bob" "Carol")
       |Carol}

Note that "@|{...}|" can be parsed as either an escape expression or
as a no-command @-form.  The latter is used in this case (since there
is little point in Scheme code that uses braces.

  @|{blah}|    --reads-as-->    ("blah")

* Comments

As noted above, there are two kinds of Scribble comments: "@;{...}" is
a (nestable) comment for a whole body of text (following the same
rules for @-forms), and "@;..." is a line-comment.

  @foo{First line@;{there is still a
                    newline here;}
       Second line}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "First line" "\n" "Second line")

One useful property of line-comments is that they continue to the end
of the line *and* all following spaces (or tabs).  Using this, you can
get further control of the subforms.

  @foo{A long @;
       single-@;
       string arg.}
  --reads-as-->
  (foo "A long single-string arg.")

Note how this is different from using "@||"s in that strings around it
are not merged.

* Spaces, Newlines, and Indentation

The Scribble syntax treats spaces and newlines in a special way is
meant to be sensible for dealing with text.  As mentioned above,
spaces at the beginning and end of body lines are discarded, except
for spaces between a "{" and text, or between text and a "}".

  @foo{bar}         --reads-as-->    (foo "bar")

  @foo{ bar }       --reads-as-->    (foo " bar ")

  @foo{ bar         --reads-as-->    (foo " bar" "\n" "baz ")
       baz }

A single newline that follows an open brace or precedes a closing
brace is discarded, unless there are only newlines in the body; other
newlines are read as a "\n" string

  @foo{bar     --reads-as-->    (foo "bar")
  }

  @foo{
    bar        --reads-as-->    (foo "bar")
  }

  @foo{

    bar        --reads-as-->    (foo "\n" "bar" "\n")

  }

  @foo{
    bar
               --reads-as-->    (foo "bar" "\n" "\n" "baz")
    baz
  }

  @foo{        --reads-as-->    (foo "\n")
  }

  @foo{
               --reads-as-->    (foo "\n" "\n")
  }

  @foo{ bar    --reads-as-->    (foo " bar" "\n" "baz ")
       baz }

In the parsed S-expression syntax, a single newline string is used for
all newlines; you can use `eq?' to identify this line.  This can be
used to identify newlines in the original <text-body>.

  (let ([nl (car @'{
                   })])
    (for-each (lambda (x) (display (if (eq? x nl) "\n... " x)))
              @`{foo
                 @,@(list "bar" "\n" "baz")
                 blah})
    (newline))
  --prints-->
  foo
  ... bar
  baz
  ... blah

Spaces at the beginning of body lines do not appear in the resulting
S-expressions, but the column of each line is noticed, and all-space
indentation strings are added so the result has the same indentation.
A indentation string is added to each line according to its distance
from the leftmost syntax object (except for empty lines).  (Note: if
you try these examples on a mzscheme REPL, you should be aware that
the reader does not know about the "> " prompt.)

  @foo{       --reads-as-->    (foo "bar" "\n"
    bar                             "baz" "\n"
    baz                             "blah")
    blah
  }

  @foo{       --reads-as-->    (foo "begin" "\n"
    begin                           "  " "x++;" "\n"
      x++;                          "end")
    end}

  @foo{       --reads-as-->    (foo "  " "a" "\n"
      a                             " " "b" "\n"
     b                              "c")
    c}

If the first string came from the openning "{" line, it is not
prepended with an indentation (but it can affect the leftmost syntax
object used for indentation).  This makes sense when formatting
structured code as well as text (see the last example in the following
block).

  @foo{bar    --reads-as-->    (foo "bar" "\n"
         baz                        "  " "baz" "\n"
       bbb}                         "bbb")

  @foo{ bar   --reads-as-->    (foo " bar" "\n"
          baz                       "   " "baz" "\n"
        bbb}                        " " "bbb")

  @foo{bar    --reads-as-->    (foo "bar" "\n"
     baz                            "baz" "\n"
     bbb}                           "bbb")

  @foo{ bar   --reads-as-->    (foo " bar" "\n"
     baz                            "baz" "\n"
     bbb}                           "bbb")

  @foo{ bar   --reads-as-->    (foo " bar" "\n"
     baz                            "baz" "\n"
       bbb}                         "  " "bbb")

  @text{Some @b{bold
    text}, and
    more text.}
  --reads-as-->
  (text "Some " (b "bold" "\n" "text") ", and" "\n" "more text.")

Note that each @-form is parsed to an S-expression that has its own
indentation.  This means that Scribble source can be indented like
code, but if indentation matters then you may need to apply
indentation of the outer item to all lines of the inner one.  For
example, in

  @code{
    begin
      i = 1, r = 1
      @bold{while i < n do
              r *= i++
            done}
    end
  }
  --reads-as-->
  (code "begin" "\n"
        "  " "i = 1, r = 1" "\n"
        "  " (bold "while i < n do" "\n"
                   "  " "r *= i++" "\n"
                   "done") "\n"
        "end")

a formatter will need to apply the 2-space indentation to the
rendering of the `bold' body.

Note that to get a first-line text to be counted as a leftmost line,
line and column accounting should be on for the input port
(`use-at-readtable' turns them on for the current input port).
Without this,

  @foo{x1
         x2
         x3}

will not have 2-space indentations in the parsed S-expression if
source accounting is not on, but

  @foo{x1
         x2
       x3}

will (due to the last line).  Pay attention to this, as it can be a
problem with Scheme code, for example:

  @code{(define (foo x)
          (+ x 1))}

For rare situations where spaces at the beginning (or end) of lines
matter, you can begin (or end) a line with a "@||".

  @foo{
    @|| bar @||    --reads-as-->    (foo " bar " "\n" " baz")
    @|| baz}

*** Syntax Properties

The Scribble reader attaches properties to syntax objects.  These
properties might be useful in rare situations.

Forms that Scribble reads is marked with a 'scribble property, and a
value of a list of three elements: the first is 'form, the second is
the number of items that were read from the datum part, and the third
is the number of items in the body part (strings, sub-forms, and
escapes).  In both cases, a 0 means an empty datum/body part, and #f
means that the corresponding part was omitted.  If the form has
neither parts, the property is not attached to the result.  This
property can be used to give different meanings to expressions from
the datum and the body parts, for example, implicitly quoted keywords:

  (define-syntax (foo stx)
    (let ([p (syntax-property stx 'scribble)])
      (syntax-case stx ()
        [(_ x ...)
         (and (pair? p) (eq? (car p) 'form) (even? (cadr p)))
         (let loop ([n (/ (cadr p) 2)]
                    [as '()]
                    [xs (syntax->list #'(x ...))])
           (if (zero? n)
             #`(list 'foo `#,(reverse as) #,@xs)
             (loop (sub1 n)
                   (cons #`(#,(car xs) ,#,(cadr xs)) as)
                   (cddr xs))))])))
  @foo[x 1 y (* 2 3)]{blah}
  --> (foo ((x 1) (y 6)) "blah")

In addition, the Scribble parser uses syntax properties to mark syntax
items that are not physically in the original source -- indentation
spaces and newlines.  Both of these will have a 'scribble property; an
indentation string of spaces will have 'indentation as the value of
the property, and a newline will have a '(newline S) value where S is
the original newline string including spaces that precede and follow
it (which includes the indentation for the following item).  This can
be used to implement a verbatim environment: drop indentation strings,
and use the original source strings instead of single-newline string.
Here is an example of this.

  (define-syntax (verb stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      [(_ cmd item ...)
       #`(cmd
          #,@(let loop ([items (syntax->list #'(item ...))])
               (if (null? items)
                 '()
                 (let* ([fst  (car items)]
                        [prop (syntax-property fst 'scribble)]
                        [rst  (loop (cdr items))])
                   (cond [(eq? prop 'indentation) rst]

*** Interface

The "reader.ss" module provides very little functionality for advanced
needs.

> (read [input-port])
> (read-syntax [source-name] [input-port])

These procedures implement the Scribble reader.  They do so by
constructing a reader table based on the current one, and using that
in reading.

> (read-inside [input-port])
> (read-syntax-inside [source-name] [input-port])

These `-inside' variants parse as if starting inside a "@{...}", and
they return a (syntactic) list.  Useful for implementing languages
that are textual by default (see "docreader.ss" for example).

> (make-at-readtable [keyword-args...])

Constructs an @-readtable.  The keyword arguments can customize the
resulting reader in several ways.

* #:readtable -- a readtable to base the @-readtable on.  Defaults to
  the current readtable.

* #:command-char -- the character used for @-forms; defaults to `#\@'.

* #:datum-readtable -- determines the readtable used for reading the
  datum part.  The default (#t) is to use the @-readtable, otherwise
  it can be a readtable, or a readtable-to-readtable function that
  will construct one from the @-readtable.  The idea is that you may
  want to have completely different uses for the datum part, for
  example, introducing a convenient `key=val' syntax for attributes.

* #:syntax-post-processor -- a function that is applied on each
  resulting syntax value after it has been parsed (but before it is
  wrapped quoting punctuations).  You can use this to further control
  uses of @-forms, for example, making the command be the head of a
  list:

    (use-at-readtable
      #:syntax-post-processor
      (lambda (stx)
        (syntax-case stx ()
          [(cmd rest ...) #'(list 'cmd rest ...)]
          [_else (error "@ forms must have a body")])))

  Beware that the syntax may contain placeholder values at this stage
  (e.g: the command part), so you can `plant' your own form that will
  do some plain processing later.  For example, here's a setup that
  uses a `mk-' prefix for all command names:

    (use-at-readtable
      #:syntax-post-processor
      (lambda (stx)
        (syntax-case stx ()
          [(cmd rest ...) #'(add-mk cmd rest ...)]
          [_else (error "@ forms must have a body")])))
    (define-syntax (add-mk stx)
      (syntax-case stx ()
        [(_ cmd rest ...)
         (identifier? #'cmd)
         (with-syntax ([mk-cmd (datum->syntax-object
                                #'cmd
                                (string->symbol
                                 (format "mk-~a" (syntax-e #'cmd)))
                                #'cmd)])
           (syntax/loc stx (mk-cmd rest ...)))]))

> (use-at-readtable [keyword-args])

Installs the Scribble readtable as the default.  Useful for REPL
experimentation.  (Note: enables line and column tracking.)  The given
keyword arguments are used with `make-at-readtable'.
