The Compiler
============

To use the compiler within a Scheme program, require _compiler.ss_:
  (require (lib "compiler.ss" "compiler"))
The _compiler.ss_ library defines the following functions (plus a few
signatures).  Options that control the compiler are documented in the
next section.

 Single-file extension compilation
 ---------------------------------

>  ((compile-extensions expr) scheme-file-list dest-dir)

      `(compile-extensions expr)' returns a compiler that is
      initialized with the expression `expr', as described below.

      The compiler takes a list of Scheme files and compiles each of
      them to an extension, placing the resulting extensions in the
      directory specified by `dest-dir'.  If `dest-dir' is #f, each
      extension is placed in the same directory as its source file.
      If `dest-dir' is 'auto, each extension file is placed in a
      "compiled/native/<PLATFORM>" subdirectory relative to the source
      file, where <PLATFORM> is the result of
      `system-library-subpath'. (The directory is created if
      necessary.)

      `expr' effect:

       If `expr' is anything other than #f, then a namespace is
       created for compiling the files that are supplied later; `expr'
       is evaluated to initialize the created namespace. For example,
       `expr' might load a set of macros. In addition, the
       expansion-time part of each expression later compiled is
       evaluated in the namespace before being compiled, so that the
       effects are visible when compiling later expressions.

       If `expr' is #f, then no compilation namespace is created, and
       expressions in the files are assumed to compile independently
       (so there's no need to evaluate the expansion-time part of an
       expression to compile).

       Typically, `expr' is #f for compiling `module' files and
       `(void)' for compiling files with top-level definitions and
       expressions.

>  ((compile-extensions-to-c expr) scheme-file-list dest-dir)

     Like `compile-extensions', but only .c files are produced, not
     extensions.

>  (compile-c-extensions c-file-list dest-dir)

     Compiles each .c file (usually produced with `compile-extensions-to-c') 
     in c-file-list to an extension.  `dest-dir' is handled as in
     `compile-extensions'.

 Multi-file extension compilation
 ---------------------------------

>  ((compile-extension-parts expr) scheme-file-list dest-dir)

      `(compile-extension-parts expr)' returns a compiler that is
      initialized with the expression `expr'.

      See `compile-extensions' above for information about the effect
      of `expr'.

      The compiler takes a list of Scheme files and compiles each of
      them to a linkable object and a .kp (constant pool) file,
      placing the resulting objects and .kp files in the directory
      specified by `dest-dir'.  If `dest-dir' is #f, each object and
      .kp file is placed in the same directory as its source file.  If
      `dest-dir' is 'auto, each .kp file is placed in a
      "compiled/native" subdirectory relative to the source file, and
      each object file is placed in "compiled/native/<PLATFORM>",
      where <PLATFORM> is the result of `system-library-subpath'. (The
      directory is created if necessary.)

>  ((compile-extension-parts-to-c expr)  scheme-file-list dest-dir)

     Like `compile-extension-parts', but only .c and .kp files are
     produced, not compiled objects. If `dest-dir' is 'auto, each
     output file is placed in a "compiled/native" subdirectory
     relative to the source file.

>  (compile-c-extension-parts c-file-list dest-dir)

     Compiles each .c file (produced with `compile-extension-parts-to-c')
     in c-file-list to an extension.

>  (link-extension-parts obj-and-kp-file-list dest-dir)

     Links objects for a multi-object extension together, using .kp
     files to generate and link pooled constants.  The objects and
     .kp files in `obj-and-kp-file' can be in any order.  The resulting
     extension "_loader" is placed in the directory specified by `dest-dir'.

>  (glue-extension-parts obj-and-kp-file-list dest-dir)

     Like `link-extension-parts', but only a "_loader" object file
     is generated; this object file is linked with all the other
     object files to produce the "_loader" extension.

 zo compilation
 --------------

>  ((compile-zos expr) scheme-file-list dest-dir)

      `(compile-zos expr)' returns a compiler that is initialized with
      the expression `expr'.

      See `compile-extensions' above for information about the effect
      of `expr'.

      The returned compiler takes a list of Scheme files and compiles
      each of them to a .zo file, placing the resulting .zo files in
      the directory specified by `dest-dir'.  If `dest-dir' is #f,
      each .zo file is placed in the same directory as its source
      file. If `dest-dir' is 'auto, each .zo file is placed in a
      "compiled" subdirectory relative to the source file. (The
      directory is created if necessary.)

 Collection compilation
 ----------------------

>  (compile-collection-extension collection sub-collection ...)

      Compiles the specified (sub-)collection to an extension
      "_loader", putting intermediate .c and .kp files in the
      collection's "compiled/native" directory, and object files and
      the resulting "_loader" extension in the collection's
      "compiled/native/PLATFORM" directory (where `PLATFORM' is the
      system name for the current platform).

      The collection compiler reads the collection's _info.ss_ file
      (see the mzc manual for information about info.ss) to obtain
      information about compiling the collection.  The following
      fields are used:

>      name - the name of the collection as a string.

>      compile-omit-files - a list of filenames (without paths); all
         Scheme files in the collection are compiled except for the
         files in this list.  Note: files that are required by other
         files that are compiled will get compiled in the process even
         when listed here.

>      compile-extension-omit-files - a list of filenames to extend
         the list returned for `compile-omit-files'. Unlike the list
         returned for `compile-omit-files', this extension is not used
         when compiling .zo files.

>      compile-subcollections - a list of collection paths, where each
         path is a list of strings. `compile-collection-extension' is 
         applied to each of the collections.

      Only the `name' field is required from info.ss.(Note: Setup PLT
      uses this field as an indication that the collection should be
      compiled.)

      The compilation process is driven by the 'make-collection'
      function in the "collection.ss" library of the "make"
      collection.

>  (compile-directory-extension path info-function)

      Like `compile-collection-extension', but compiles the given 
      directory rather than a collection. Also takes an info
      function (the result of `get-info' or `get-info/full'; see 
      the setup collection's documentation for more information)
      that will be used to guide compilation instead of looking for
      an info.ss file in the directory.

>  (compile-collection-zos collection sub-collection ...)

      Compiles the specified (sub-)collection files to .zo files.
      The .zo files are placed into the collection's "compiled"
      directory.

      The _info.ss_ file is used as in `compile-collection-extension',
      except for `compile-extension-omit-files'. In addition, the
      following two fields are used:

>      compile-zo-omit-files - a list of filenames to extend the
         list returned for 'compile-omit-files.

      The compilation process is driven by the `managed-compile-zo'
      function in the "cm.ss" library of the "mzlib" collection.

>  (compile-directory-zos path info-function)

      Like `compile-collection-zos', but compiles the given directory
      rather than a collection. Also takes an info function (the
      result of `get-info' or `get-info/full'; see the setup
      collection's documentation for more information) that will be
      used to guide compilation instead of looking for an info.ss file
      in the directory.


 Loading compiler support
 ------------------------

The compiler unit loads certain tools on demand via `dynamic-require'
and `get-info'. If the namespace used during compilation is different
from the namespace used to load the compiler, or if other load-related
parameters are set, then the following parameter can be used to
restore settings for `dynamic-require'.

>  current-compiler-dynamic-require-wrapper

    A parameter whose value is a procedure that takes a thunk to
    apply. The default wrapper sets the current namespace (via
    `parameterize') before calling the thunk; it sets it to the
    namespace that was current at the time that the "compiler-unit.ss"
    module was evaluated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options for the Compiler
========================

To set options for the _compile.ss_ extension compiler, use the
_option.ss_ module. Options are set by the following parameters:

> verbose - #t causes the compiler to print
     verbose messages about its operations.  Default = #f.

> setup-prefix - a string to embed in public names.
     This is used mainly for compiling extensions with the collection
     name so that cross-extension conflicts are less likely in
     architectures that expose the public names of loaded extensions.
     Note that `compile-collection' handles prefixing automatically
     (by setting this option).  Default = "".

> clean-intermediate-files - #t keeps intermediate
     .c/.o files.  Default = #f.

> compile-subcollections - #t uses info.ss's
     'compile-subcollections' for compiling collections. Default = #t.

> compile-for-embedded - #t creates .c files and
     object files to be linked directly with an embedded MzScheme
     run-time system, instead of .c files and object files to
     be dynamically loaded into MzScheme as an extension.
     Default = #f.

> propagate-constants - #t improves the code by
     propagating constants.  Default = #t.

> assume-primitives - #t adds `(require mzscheme)'
     to the beginning of the program. This is useful only 
     with non-`module' code.
     Default = #f.

> stupid - Allow obvious non-syntactic errors; e.g.:
    ((lambda () 0) 1 2 3).  Default = #f.

> vehicles - Controls how closures are compiled.  The
    possible values are: 'vehicles:automatic - auto-groups
                         'vehicles:functions - groups by procedure
                         'vehicles:units - usupported
                         'vehicles:monolithic - groups randomly
    Default = 'vehicles:automatic.

> vehicles:monoliths - Sets the number of random
    groups for 'vehicles:monolithic.

> seed - Sets the randomizer seed for
    'vehicles:monolithic.

> max-exprs-per-top-level-set - Sets the number of
    top-level Scheme expressions crammed into one C function.  Default
    = 25.

> unpack-environments - #f might help for
    register-poor architectures.  Default = #t.

> debug - #t creates debug.txt debugging file.  Default
    = #f.

> test - #t ignores top-level expressions with syntax
   errors.  Default = #f.

More options are defined by the compile.ss and link.ss libraries in
the `dynext' collection . Those options control the actual C compiler
and linker that are used. See doc.txt in the `dynext' collection for
more information about those options.

The _option-unit.ss_ library is a unit exporting the signature
>    compiler:option^
which contains these options. The _sig.ss_ library defines the
`compiler:option^' signature.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Compiler as a Unit
======================

The _compiler-unit.ss_ library provides a unit
>      compiler@
exporting the signature
>      compiler^ 
which provides the compiler.ss functions.  This signature and all
auxiliary signatures needed by compiler@ are defined by the
_sig.ss_ library.

The signed unit requires the following imports:

   compiler:option^ - From sig.ss, impl by _option-unit.ss_ or _option.ss_
   dynext:compile^ - From the `dynext' collection
   dynext:link^
   dynext:file^

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low-level Extension Compiler and Linker
=======================================

The high-level compiler.ss interface relies on low-level
implementations of the extension compiler and linker.

The _comp-unit.ss_ and _ld-unit.ss_ libraries define units for the
low-level extension compiler and multi-file linker,
> ld@
and
> comp@
respectively.

The low-level compiler functions from comp@ are:

> (eval-compile-prefix expr) - Evaluates an S-expression `expr'.
    Future calls to mzc:compile-XXX will see the effects of the
    expression.

> (compile-extension scheme-source dest-dir) - Compiles a
    single Scheme file to an extension.

> (compile-extension-to-c scheme-source dest-dir) - Compiles
    a single Scheme file to a .c file.

> (compile-c-extension c-source dest-dir) - Compiles a single .c
    file to an extension.

> (compile-extension-part scheme-source dest-dir) - Compiles a
    single Scheme file to a compiled object and .kp file toward a
    multi-file extension.

> (compile-extension-part-to-c scheme-source dest-dir) - Compiles
    a single Scheme file to .c and .kp files towards a multi-file
    extension.

> (compile-c-extension-part c-source dest-dir) - Compiles a single
    .c file to a compiled object towards a multi-file extension.

The low-level linker functions from ld@ are:

> (link-extension object-and-kp-file-list dest-dir) - Links
    compiled object and .kp files into a multi-file extension.


Both units require the following imports:

   dynext:compile^ - From the `dynext' collection
   dynext:link^
   dynext:file^
   compiler:option^ - From sig.ss, impl by _option-unit.ss_ or _option.ss_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embedding Scheme Code to Create a Stand-alone Executable
========================================================

The _embed.ss_ library provides a function to embed Scheme code into a
copy of MzScheme or MrEd, thus creating a _stand-alone_ Scheme
executable. To package the executable into a distribution that is
indpendent of your PLT installation, use `assemble-distribution'
from "distribute.ss"

Embedding walks the module dependency graph to find all modules needed
by some initial set of top-level modules, compiling them if needed,
and combining them into a "module bundle". In addition to the module
code, the bundle extends the module name resolver, so that modules can
be `require'd with their original names, and they will be retrieved
from the bundle instead of the filesystem.

The `make-embedding-executable' function combines the bundle with an
executable (MzScheme or MrEd). The `write-module-bundle' function
prints the bundle to the current output port, instead; this stream can
be `load'ed directly by a running program, as long as the
`read-accept-compiled' parameter is true.

The _embedr-unit.ss_ library provides a unit, _compiler:embed@_
that imports nothing and exports the functions below. The
_embedr-sig.ss_ library provides the signature, _compiler:embed^_.

> (create-embedding-executable dest 
                               [#:modules mod-list] 
                               [#:literal-files literal-file-list] 
                               [#:literal-expression literal-sexp]
                               [#:cmdline cmdline-list] 
                               [#:mred? mred?]

                               [#:src-filter src-filter-proc]
                               [#:get-extra-imports extra-imports-proc])
  - Copies the MzScheme (if `mred?' is #f) or MrEd (otherwise) binary,
  embedding code into the copied executable to be loaded on startup.
  (Under Unix, the binary is actually a wrapper executable that execs
  the original; see also 'original-exe? below.)

  See the mzc documentation for a simpler interface that is
  well-suited to programs defined with `module'.

  The embedding executable is written to `dest', which is
  overwritten if it exists already (as a file or directory).

  The embedded code consists of module declarations followed by
  additional (arbitrary) code. When a module is embedded, every module
  that it imports is also embedded. Library modules are embedded so
  that they are accessible via their `lib' paths in the initial
  namespace' except as specified in `mod-list', other modules
  (accessed via local paths and absolute paths) are embedded with a
  generated prefix, so that they are not directly accessible.

  The `mod-list' argument designates modules to be embedded, as
  described below. The `literal-file-list' and `literal-sexp'
  arguments specify literal code to be copied into the executable:
  the content of each file in `literal-file-list' is copied in order
  (with no intervening space), followed by `literal-sexp'. The
  `literal-file-list' files or `literal-sexp' can contain compiled
  bytecode, and it's possible that the content of the
  `literal-file-list' files only parse when concatenated; the files
  and expression are not compiled or inspected in any way during the
  embedding process. If `literal-sexp' is #f, no literal expression is
  included in the executable.

  The `cmdline-list' argument contains command-line strings that are
  prefixed onto any actual command-line arguments that are provided to
  the embedding executable. A command-line argument that evaluates an
  expression or loads a file will be executed after the embedded code
  is loaded.

  Each element of the `mod-list' argument is a 2-item list, where the
  first item is a prefix for the module name, and the second item is a
  module path datum (that's in the format understood by the default
  module name resolver). The prefix can be a symbol, #f to indicate no
  prefix, or #t to indicate an auto-generated prefix. For example,

    '((#f "m.ss"))

  embeds the module `m' from the file "m.ss", without prefixing the
  name of the module; the `literal-sexpr' argument to go with the
  above might be '(require m).

  All modules are compiled before they are embedded into the target
  executable; see also `compile-proc' below. When a module declares
  run-time paths via the forms of MzLib's "runtime-path.ss", the
  generated executable records the path (for use both by immediate
  execution and for creating a distribution tha contains the
  executable).

  When embedding into a copy of MrEd, a "-Z" flag should usually be
  included in the list of command-line flags, so that the target
  executable has a chance to see an embedded declaration of (lib
  "mred.ss" "mred"). Then, if the literal code expect to have MrEd and
  the class library required into the top-level namespace, literal
  `require's for those libraries should be included at the start.

  The optional `aux' argument is an association list for
  platform-specific options (i.e., it is a list of pairs where the
  first element of the pair is a key symbol and the second element is
  the value for that key). The currently supported keys are as
  follows:

      _'icns_ (Mac OS X) - an icon file path (suffix ".icns") to
              use for the executable's desktop icon

      _'ico_ (Windows) - an icon file path (suffix ".ico") to
              use for the executable's desktop icon; the executable
              will have 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 icons at 4-bit,
              8-bit, and 32-bit (RBBA) depths; the icons are
              copied and generated from any 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48
              icons in the ".ico" file

      _'creator_ (Mac OS X) - provides a 4-character string to use as
              the application signature

      _'file-types_ (Mac OS X) - provides a list of association lists,
              one for each type of file handled by the application;
              each association is a 2-element list, where the first (key)
              element is a string recognized by Finder, and the second
              element is a plist value (see doc.tx in the "xml" collection);
              see plt/collects/drscheme/drscheme.filetypes for an example

      -'resource-files_ (Mac OS X) - extra files to copy into the
              "Resources" directory of the generated executable

      _'framework-root_ (Mac OS X) - a string to prefix the
              executable's path to the MzScheme and MrEd frameworks
              (including a separating slash); note that when the
              prefix start "@executable_path/" works for a
              MzScheme-based application, the corresponding prefix
              start for a MrEd-based application is
              "@executable_path/../../../"; if #f is supplied, the
              executable's framework path is left as-is, otherwise
              the original executable's path to a framework is
              converted to an absolute path if it was relative

      _'dll-dir_ (Windows) - a string/path to a directory that
              contains PLT DLLs needed by the executable, such as
              "pltmzsch<version>.dll", or a boolean; a path can be
              relative to the executable; if #f is supplied, the path
              is left as-is; if #t is supplied, the path is dropped
              (so that the DLLs must be in the system directory or the
              user's PATH); if no value is supplied the original
              executable's path to DLLs is converted to an absolute
              path if it was relative

      _'subsystem_ (Windows) - a symbol, either 'console for a console
              application or 'windows for a consoleless application;
              the default is 'console for a MzScheme-based application
              and 'windows for a MrEd-based application; see also
              'single-instance?, below

      _'single-instance?_ (Windows) - a boolean for MrEd-based apps; the
              default is #t, which means that the app looks for instances
              of itself on startup and merely brings the other instance to
              the front; #f means that multiple instances are expected

      _'forget-exe?_ (Windows, Mac OS X) - a boolean; #t for a launcher
              (see `launcher?' below) does not preserve the original
              executable name for `(find-system-path 'exec-file)'; the
              main consequence is that library collections will be
              found relative to the launcher instead of the original
              executable

      _'original-exe?_ (Unix) - a boolean; #t means that the embedding
              uses the original MzScheme or MrEd executable, instead
              of a wrapper binary that execs the original; the default is
              #f

   See also `build-aux-from-path' in the "launcher" collection. The
   default `aux' is `null'.

   If the #:collects-path argument is #f, then the created executable
   maintains its built-in (relative) path to the main "collects"
   directory --- which will be the result of `(find-system-path
   'collects-dir)' when the executable is run --- plus a potential
   list of other directories for finding library collections --- which
   are used to initialize the `current-library-collection-paths' list
   in combination with "PLTCOLLECTS" environment variable.  Otherwise,
   the argument specifies a replacement; it must be either a path,
   string, or non-empty list of paths and strings. In the last case,
   the first path or string specifies the main collection directory,
   and the rest are additional directories for the collection search
   path (placed, in order, after the user-specific "collects"
   directory, but before the main "collects" directory; then the
   search list is combined with "PLTCOLLECTS", if it is defined).

   If the `on-extension' argument is a procedure, the procedure is
   called when the traversal of module dependencies arrives at an
   extension (i.e., a DLL or shared object). The default, #f, causes a
   reference to a single-module extension (in its current location) to
   be embedded into the executable, since an extension itself cannot
   be embedded in executables, the default raises an erorr when only a
   _loader (instead of a single-module extension) variant is
   available. The procedure is called with two arguments: a path for
   the extension, and a boolean that is #t if the extension is a
   _loader variant.

   If `launcher?' is #t, then no `modules' should be null,
   `literal-file-list' should be null, `literal-sexp' should be #f,
   and the platform should be Windows or Mac OS X. The embedding
   executable is created in such a way that `(find-system-path
   'exec-file)' produces the source MzScheme or MrEd path instead of
   the embedding executable (but the result of `(find-system-path
   'run-file)' is still the embedding executable).

   The `variant' argument indicates which variant of the original
   binary to use for embedding. The default is `(system-type 'gc)';
   see `current-launcher-variant' in the "launcher" collection for
   more information.

   The `compile-proc' argument is used to compile the source of
   modules to be included in the executable (when a compiled form is
   not already available). It should accept a single argument that is
   a syntax object for a `module' form. The default procedure uses
   `compile' parameterized to set the current namespace to
   `expand-namespace'.

   The `expand-namespace' argument selects a namespace for expanding
   extra modules (and for compiling using the default `compile-proc').
   Extra-module expansion is needed to detect run-time path
   declarations in included modules, so that the path resolutions can
   be directed to the current locations (and, unltimately, redirected
   to copies in a distribution).

   The `src-filter-proc' takes a path and returns true if the
   corresponding file source be included in the embedding executable
   in source form (insteda of compiled form), #f otherwise. The
   default returns #f for all paths. Beware that the current output
   port may be redirected to the result executable when the filter
   procedure is called.
  
   The `extra-imports-proc' takes a source pathname and compiled
   module for each module to be included in the executable. It returns
   a list of quoted module paths (absolute, as opposed to relative to
   the module) for extra modules to be included in the executable in
   addition to the modules that the source module `require's,
   `require-for-syntax's, and `require-for-template's. For example,
   these modules might correspond to reader extensions needed to parse
   a module that will be included as source, as long as the reader is
   referenced through an absolute module path.

> (make-embedding-executable dest mred? verbose? mod-list literal-file-list literal-sexpr cmdline-list [aux launcher? variant])

   Old (keywordless) interface to `create-embedding-executable'.

> (write-module-bundle verbose? mod-list literal-file-list literal-sexpr)
  - Like `make-embedding-executable', but the module bundle is written
  to the current output port instead of being embedded into an
  executable.  The output of this function can be `read' to load and
  instantiate `mod-list' and its dependencies, adjust the module name
  resolver to find the newly loaded modules, evaluate the forms
  included from `literal-file-list', and finally evaluate
  `literal-sexpr'. The `read-accept-compiled' parameter must be true
  to read the stream.


> (embedding-executable-is-directory? mred?) - Returns #t if
  Mzscheme/MrEd executables for the current platform correspond to
  directories from the user's perspective.

> (embedding-executable-is-actually-directory? mred?) - Returns #t if
  Mzscheme/MrEd executables for the current platform are implemented
  as directories (as on Mac OS X).


> (embedding-executable-put-file-extension+style+filters mred?) -
  Returns three values suitable for use as the `extension', `style',
  and `filters' arguments to `put-file', respectively. If
  MzScheme/MrEd launchers for this platform are directories, the
  `style' result is suitable for use with `get-directory', and the
  `extension' result may be a string indicating a required extension
  for the directory name (e.g., "app" for Mac OS X).


> (embedding-executable-add-suffix path mred?) - Returns a path with a
  suitable executable suffix added, if it's not present already.

Assembling Stand-alone Executables with Shared Libraries
========================================================

The _distribute.ss_ library provides a function to combine a
stand-alone executable created with "embed.ss" with any DLLs,
frameworks, or shared libraries that it needs to run on other machines
(with the same OS).

> (assemble-distribution dest-dir
                         list-of-exec-files
                         [#:collects-path path]
                         [#:copy-collects list-of-dirs])

  Copies the executables in `list-of-exec-files' to the directory
  `dest-dir', along with DLLs, frameworks, and/or shared libraries
  that the executables need to run a different machine.

  The arrangement of the executables and support files in `dest-dir'
  depends on the platform. In general `assemble-distribution' tries to
  do the Right Thing.

  If a #:collects-path argument is given, it overrides the default
  location of the main "collects" directory for the packaged
  executables. It should be relative to the `dest-dir' directory
  (typically inside it).

  The content of each directory in the #:copy-collects argument is
  copied into the main "collects" directory for the packaged
  executables.

Packing Stand-alone Executables into a Distribution
===================================================

The _bundle-dist.ss_ library provides a function to pack a directory
(usually assembled by `assemble-distribution') into a distribution
file.  Under Windows, the result is a ".zip" archive; under Mac OS X,
it's a ".dmg" disk image; under Unix, it's a ".tgz" archive.

> (bundle-directory dist-file dir [for-exe?])

  Packages `dir' into `dist-file'. If `dist-file' has no extension,
  a file extension is added automatcially (using the first result
  of `bundle-put-file-extension+style+filters').

  The created archive contains a directory with the same name as `dir'
  --- except under Mac OS X when `for-exe?' is true and `dir' contains
  a single a single file or directory, in which case the created disk
  image contains just the file or directory. The default for
  `for-exe?' is #f.

  Archive creation fails if `dist-file' exists.

> (bundle-put-file-extension+style+filters)

  Returns three values suitable for use as the `extension', `style',
  and `filters' arguments to `put-file', respectively to select
  a distribution-file name.
