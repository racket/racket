The pousse GUI can

 * play a person against another person,
 * play a person against a program,
 * play a program against another program, or

The "Setup..." button opens a dialog for selecting one of the above
modes, and for adding new program players to the system. Use
"Setup..." to reset a game or to cancel a game where two programs are
playing each other.

Person Players 
--------------
Watch the status line above the board for information. When it's your
turn, click on one of the numbers surrounding the board to move.

The left and right arrows above the board undo and redo moves,
respectively. The right side of the window shows the game played so
far, including undone moves that have not yet been replaced. The most
recent move is hilighted in blue.

When a player loses by repeating a previous board configuration, the
player's pieces turn red and no further moves are allowed (although
moves can be undone). When a player wins, the player's pieces that
form straights are turned green.

Players are encouraged to move within 30 or 60 seconds. A beep is
sounded at 30 and 60 seconds from the start of player's turn.

Program Players
---------------
While a program player is ``thinking,'' the cursor changes to a watch
over the board. When a person plays a program, clicking the left arrow
while a program is thinking cancels the program and undoes the
person's most recent move. Clicking the left arrow during the person's
turn undoes the program's last move, plus the person's previous move
(i.e., it undoes two moves).
