The math collection is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License Version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1) just like the majority of Racket's libraries.
The LGPLv2.1 license text is included in every Racket distribution, in the
file "doc/release-notes/COPYING.txt".

Some of the math library code is derived from the C++ project Boost, from
source files released under the Boost Software License Version 1.0
(BSLv1.0). This license is compatible with the LGPLv2.1, provided the
BSLv1.0 license text is distributed along with any source code derived from
BSLv1.0 works.

Some of the math library is derived from ubiquitous C libraries released
under a license with similar terms.

To comply with the terms of the BSLv1.0, its text is duplicated here:
