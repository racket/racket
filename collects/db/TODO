Testing

- run ODBC tests on Mac
- run ODBC DB2, Oracle tests on win32; also test SQL Server ?
- test util/connect features
- test transaction functions

----

Types

- type annotations
  - two modes: mandatory and opportunistic
  - on result fields (eg sqlite, convert to date)
  - on parameters ???
  - per query or per connection? (or both?)
  - either only well-known conversions, or must apply outside of lock

- postgresql record type: docs, send
- postgresql domain types, table record types, etc

- util/postgresql: add inet types
- util/geometry: add WKT functions

- add support for ODBC intervals (no point w/o driver to test with)

----

Misc

- use ffi/unsafe/alloc to simplify odbc handle allocation

- add ODBC-like functions for inspecting schemas (list-tables, etc)
  - util/schema (?), util/info (for information_schema) (?)
  - at least, table-exists? : string [...] -> boolean?

- for wrapped/managed connections, detect if underlying connection gets
  disconnected by server (eg, times out after 10 minutes of inactivity)
  - at least, pool should make sure connection is alive when gotten from idle list
  - add {keepalive : -> boolean} method to connection<%> (?)

- document/enumerate errors
- document exn:fail:sql, when used, when not used, links to SQLSTATE docs?

- disconnect on custudian shutdown (?)

- disconnect should always work, even on thread-damaged connections
  - but might need version with timeout and/or rudely? flag, because
    I can't think of a way to solve the lock problem that doesn't involve aux thread.

- finish transaction api: tests, custom sqlite options (?), custom mysql options (?)
  - add connect option #:rollback-invalid-transactions? (?)

- identify common ODBC errors that can't possibly rollback transaction
  - test with PostgreSQL ODBC driver using "rollback on all errors" mode

- more ODBC information (?)
  SQLGetInfo:
  - SQL_CONVERT_<datatype> - use to refine supported types (?)
  - SQL_CURSOR_{COMMIT,ROLLBACK}_BEHAVIOR - check that commit/rollback doesn't delete pstmts!
  - SQL_MAX_{CATALOG,COLUMN,IDENTIFIER,SCHEMA_NAME,TABLE_NAME}_NAME (min 128)

- cursors? (Olin thinks cursors are important. I'm not sure.)
  - how do people want to use cursors?
  - how about implicit support only in 'in-query'?

- add evt versions of functions
  - for query functions (?)
  - connection-pool-lease-evt
  - when is it useful in practice?
    - would make it easier to handle timeouts...
