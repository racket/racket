_GUI builder_

To run the GUI builder, use DrScheme and select "Insert GUI"
from the "Special" menu.

Though less recommended, you can also run

  (require (lib "guibuilder.ss" "guibuilder"))

to get a stand-alone builder. Save your files with the extension
".gui" to ensure that they can be re-loaded later.
