# This makefile defines default values for various build modes and
# provides targets that mostly just dispatch to "main.zuo". It can
# be used either with `make` or `nmake`.

# The main targets are
#
#  in-place = build in "racket" with all packages in development mode
#
#  as-is = like `in-place`, but don't download anything new
#
#  base = build in "collects" only (i.e., first step of `in-place`)
#
#    [`cs-` or `bc-` can prefix any of the above to select a Racket CS
#     or Racket BC build.]
#
#  server = build base, build packages listed in $(PKGS) or specified
#           via $(CONFIG), start server at port $(SERVER_PORT)
#
#  client = build base, create an installer with $(PKGS) with the help
#           of $(SERVER); result is recorded in "bundle/installer.txt"
#
#  installers = `server' plus `client' via $(CONFIG)
#
# Various configuration options can be provided as arguments to
# `make`. For example, `PKGS` can be supplied with `make PKGS="..."`.
# Not all variables in the makefile are intended as arguments,
# though.
#
# Instead of using `make`, you can use `zuo` with the same targets
# and variable options.

# OpenBSD `make` workaround

# Open BSD sees the `!` lines that are intended for `nmake`, and it
# treats them as an empty target name with dependencies `if`, `0`,
# and `endif` --- and since that empty target is the first target, it's
# treated as the default, so bounce to the actual default target

!if 0

if endif 0: in-place

!endif
