  for all connection threads
 Added define-struct/properties to MzLib's "struct.ss"
 Removed pretty-print-display-string-handler from MzLib's
  "pretty.ss", and adapted protocol for hook procedures
  slightly (i.e., they usually must write to a given port)
 Changed collects/web-server request-bindings/raw
  to return an alist of bytes, not strings
Misc:
 Cygwin build produces a Unix-style installation instead of
  a Windows-style installation (e.g., system-type is 'unix)

 Added pipe-content-length
 Changed {read,peek}-bytes-avail!{,*,/enable-break} to produce
  a special-reading procedure when a stream contains specials
 Added make-pipe-with-specials to MzLib's "port.ss"; procedures
  like copy-port now also handle specials
 Moved most of (lib "thread.ss") to (lib "port.ss"), and many
  remaining useless procedures (such as dynamic-enable-break)
  were removed
 Added port-progress-evt, port-commit-peeked, and
  port-provides-progress-evts?
 Added an optional progress-event argument to peek-bytes-avail!,
  etc., before the port argument
 Added an optional progress-event argument to regexp-match-peek

 Changed object-name for input ports and output ports
 Added write-special and write-special-avail*
 A location-offset lists for a port read handler can contain #f
 Changed read-syntax to make the source name optional (defaults
  to the port's name)
Syntax and Macros: 
 Eliminated "identifier for a definition has a module context"
  errors
 In a syntax template, when an identifier has more ellipses
  then in the pattern, inner ellipses bind more
  tightly than the outer ellipses
 New forms: require-for-template (core), define-values-for-syntax
  (core), define-for-syntax, begin-for-syntax
 New procedures: local-transformer-expand, syntax-transforming?,
  syntax-local-lift-expression, local-expand/capture-lifts,
  local-transformer-expand/capture-lift, syntax-recertify, 
  module-template-identifier=?, identifier-template-binding,
  rename-transformer-target

  syntax-local-context
 Added begin-with-definitions to (lib "etc.ss")
 Added syntax-property-symbol-keys
 Added namespace-unprotect-module
 Changed eval, expand, etc. so that only the leading
  identifier in a module form is given context
 Changed module expansion/compilation so that it's deterministic,
  as long as macros do not use gensym or external side-effects;
  using generate-temporaries preserves determinism
 Changed module->namespace and module re-definition so that they're
  controlled by the code inspector, not the modules attach state
 Added current-compile parameter, which is used by compile
  and by the default evaluation handler
 Changed expansion-time structure type info to allow #f in place
  of a mutator id
 Added construct-time field guards to structure types
 Changed raise-syntax-error so that it no longer accepts a list
  as its first argument
Reader Syntax:
 Added #<< here strings
 Added H-expression mode to reader, triggered by #hx or #honu,
  and escaped by #sx
 Added read-honu, read-honu-syntax, and print-honu
 Changed #; for top-level read; graph assignments are forgotten
  before reading the next expression
Control Flow and Paramaters:
 While an exception handler is called, the current exception
  handler is reset to the default handler; similarly,
  the error display and escape handlers are called by the
  default exception handler in a context that resets the
  corresponding parameters to the default handlers
 An exception handler can handle exceptions that are raised
  during the handler (by using with-handlers or setting the
  current-exception-handler parameter)
 During the evaluation of dynamic-wind pre and post thunks,
  the current continuation marks and parameterization are reset
  to those active at the time of the dynamic-wind call
  (except that the parameterization is extended to disable
  breaks)
 Added current-parameterization and call-with-parameterization
 Added continuation-mark-set-first
 Removed optional argument of continuation-mark-set->list
 Added continuation-mark-set->list*

 Changed the random-number generator to use L'Ecuyer's MRG32k3a
  algorithm, as encouraged by SRFI-37
 Changed random to accept 0 arguments to generate a random real
  number, and added pseudo-random-generator->vector and
  vector->pseudo-random-generator; these are compatible
  with the SRFI-27 reference implementation
 Added print-unreadable parameter
 Changed use-compiled-file-kinds to use-compiled-file-paths
 Mac OS X: extension suffix changed from ".so" to ".dylib"
Libraries:
 "class.ss" MzLib module: changed the interface to 
  make-primitive-class; see plt/collects/mzscheme/examples/tree.cxx 
  for details
 "serialize.ss" MzLib module: new
 "contract.ss" MzLib module: names are more uniform; if the name of a
  contract a suffix, the suffix is now "/c" (instead of one of "/p",
  "/c", or "/f")
 "url.ss" in the "net" collection: new url data definition; url/user is
   gone, and no extra encoding/decoding required once a url has been
   parsed anymore
Inside MzScheme: 
 Added scheme_set_type_printer, scheme_print_bytes,
  and scheme_print_string

Fixed transitivity of numerical comparison for mixed
 inexact--exact comparisons when the inexact versions
 of the numbers are = but the exact versions are not
Macro templates can include consecutive ... for splicing
 sequences
Macro patterns can include sub-patterns after ...
Improved error reporting for with-syntax
Non-constant syntax pairs generated from templates
 (in syntax-case, with-syntax, quasisyntax, etc.)
 keep source-location and context information,
 instead of acquiring the context and location of
 the generator expression as a whole
generate-temporaries produces identifiers that are
 suitable for use as defined names in the module
 being expanded (if any)
Added syntax-local-module-introduce, which is used
 by generate-temporaries

 module name resolver
MzLib's contract.ss: changed and/f to and/c, or/f is deprected
 (use union), added object contracts, flat-contracts (without
 names) are a separate type; use flat-contract-predicate rather
 than flat-named-contract, added flat-rec-contract, improved
 performance

Added namespace-syntax-introduce
Added eval-syntax, compile-syntax, expand-syntax, expand-syntax-once,
 and expand-syntax-to-top-form
Added set!-transformer-procedure
Added namespace-undefine-variable!
syntax-local-context can return a list for internal-define
 expansion, and local-expand accepts a list to mean 
 internal-define expansion; for built-in expansion, each
 list item uniquely indicates a distinct, active
 internal-define expansion context
Added syntax-local-get-shadower
Changed top-level `define-syntaxes' to treat zero results
 from the right-hand side as an abort, so that
   (define-syntax (id ...) (values))
 declares the ids. This is useful for macros that
 expand to mutuaully recursive definitions of private
 variables
Changed the expansion-time information associated with a
 struct type to include an identifier for the super-type
Handling of --main/-C command-line flag changed
Changed "scheme-<dialect>" script handling to add the script

 and thread-dead-waitable
Added make-wrapped-waitable, make-guard-waitable, and
 make-nack-guard-waitable a la CML
Added waitables->waitable-set, which is like CML's choose
Renamed make-nack-waitable to make-nack-guard-waitable
 to claify its relation to make-guard-waitable
Added make-poll-guard-waitable
Added make-semaphore-peek
Added current-wait-pseudo-random-generator
Changed unreachable threads to be garbage-collected when
 blocked on any combination of otherwise unreachable
 waitables by object-wait-multiple, semaphore-wait, 
 channel-put, channge-get, or thread-wait; in addition,
 unreachable suspended threads are garbage-collected
Added "async-channel.ss" to MzLib
Changed make-custom-input-port to drop the initial
 waitable argument; instead, the read and peek
 functions should return a waitable instead of 0
Changed make-custom-output-port so that the first
 argument is #f or a procedure to return a waitable
 (instead of #f or a waitable)
Added tcp-port?
Added port-file-identity
Deprecated normal-case-path
Changed the symbolic name for a file-based module to be
 determined without using normal-case-path

 procedure for the property
Changed make-struct-type to accept a list of immutable
 field positions
Changed struct-type-info to return 8 values instead of 6
 to include information on immutable fields
Changed proc-spec handling in make-struct-type; an integer
 value must be < init-field-k, and overriding is disallowed
 (for consistency with user-defined properties)
Added prop:waitable
Changed handling of top-level and module top-level definitions
 of identifiers that originate from a macro expansion; such
 definitions now bind only the uses of the identifier with the
 same expansion origin
Added make-syntax-introducer, for creating new macro origins
Changed generate-temporaries so that it does not use gensym,
 but instead uses make-syntax-introducer to distinguish names
Added make-rename-transformer and rename-transformer?
Changed syntax-local-value to cooperate specially with
 rename transformers
Fixed parse problems with # in numbers, as in `1#/2' and
 `#e#x+e#s+e@-e#l-e'
Added literal hashtable syntax #hash..., added support
 for immutable hash tables, and added print-hash-table
 parameter
Added literal regexp syntax #rx... and changed the printer
 to use this notation for printing regexps

Version 201, July 2002
Fixed bug in port reading (especially variants of read-string)
 and file-position that follow peeks on the port
Added exn:special-comment, expected to be used by custom input ports
 that contain non-character-based comments (e.g., the comment boxes
 soon to appear in DrScheme)
Windows: added special handling of "special files" (COM1, etc.);
 internally MzScheme opens the file only once to satisfy multiple
 open-input-file and open-output-file calls that have the
 port open at the same time

Version 200, June 2002

 now a Scheme_Object*

Version 100, August 9, 1999
 + indicates a change since 100alpha4
 * indicates a change since 100alpha3
Changed class syntax, splitting public clause use into:
 public : defines ivars not in superclass
 override : defines ivars already in superclass
Changed empty superclass from the empty list to object%;
 every class initialization must call super-init
Added ivar-in-interface?
+ Added class-initialization-arity
* Added class->interface
* Added object-interface
+ Removed object-class
+ Removed ivar-in-class?; replace (ivar-in-class? x c)
 with (ivar-in-interface? (class->interface x c))
Changed interface: raises an exception if a superinterface
 declares a variable that is also declared in the interface
 expression
Removed letrec*; letrec has the same semantics
* Fixed scope of function name in a named let
Internal definitions are allowed only at the beginning of lambda,
 case-lambda, let, let-values, let*, let*-values,
 letrec, letrec-values, fluid-let, let-macro, let-id-macro,
 let-expansion-time, parameterize, and with-handlers
begin expressions are flattened in an internal-definition context
(begin) allowed in a top-level, unit, or internal-definition
 context
Removed invoke-open-unit; see the new invoke.ss library, which
 includes define-values/invoke-unit
Self-import is now allowed for unit linking
Removed constant-name and constant-name-all-globals
Removed secure-primitive-exception-types
Removed readable type symbols (e.g., #<procedure>)
Removed semaphore-callback (MrEd now has queue-callback)
Removed parameterizations (but not parameters!)
parameterize sets parameter values in parallel (like let)
 instead of in series (like let*)
* Changed the initialization of the exception handler in a new
 thread to use the value of the initial-exception-handler
 parameter
Fixed unfairness in threads (perpetually creating threads
 would starve certain threads, particularly the main thread)
Unreachable thread blocked on an unreachable semaphore is
 garbage-collectable
Added current-memory-use
Fixed weak hash table bug (could drop keys too soon)
Added optional peek-proc argument to make-input-port
Changed TCP writes to block when the underlying implementation
 blocks, and removed tcp-port-send-waiting?
Asynchronous breaks are now disabled during dynamic-wind
 pre and post thunks
Removed user-break-poll-handler; spawn a thread that sleeps and
 calls break-thread, instead
Removed dynamic-enable-break (no long needed since dynamic-wind
 post thunks can't be broken), but moved it to MzLib's thread.ss
Removed execption-break-enabled (now always disabled)
Added call-in-nested-thread
Removed thread-weight
Renamed the call-with-escaping-continution procedure to
 call-with-escape-continution (call/ec is unchanged)
Finished with-continuation-mark and current-continuation-marks
 and documented them; the errortrace poor man's debugger relies
 on continuation marks; see plt/collects/errortrace/doc.txt
Removed debug-info-handler and replaced the debug-info field
 with a continuation-marks field
Added raise-mismatch-error
MacOS: getenv and putenv work within MzScheme; if a file named
 "Environment" resides in MzScheme's folder, it provides the
 initial environment; see the documentation for details
MacOS: fixed TCP problems
Fixed read-write invariance for inexact (floating-point) numbers
Changed handling of inexact can complex numbers towards compliance
 with Brad Lucier's proposal:
  (* 0 x) = 0 for all x
  (log 1) = 0, etc.
  -0.0 and 0.0 are properly distinguished; (- 0.0) = -0.0, and
   (/ (expt 2 400) -inf.0) = -0.0; (eqv? 0.0 -0.0) = #f even
   though (= 0.0 -0.0) = #t
  Complex numbers can have an inexact real/imaginary part with
   an exact zero imaginary/real part; thus, 4.0 is different
   from 4.0+0.0i, and 0+4.0i is different from 0.0+4.0i; note
   that (sqrt -4.0) is 0+2.0i
  Complex numbers can have a +nan.0 real/imaginary part with
   an imaginary/real part that is not +nan.0
All zero-length vectors are eq
Vectors are written (but not displayed) using the Chez-style
 #n(...) shorthand by default; added print-vector-length
 parameter
* The value of a built-in procedure is eq across namespaces
Replaced require-library-use-compiled with use-compiled-file-kinds
Changed interface for wills: no current executor, register-will
 -> will-register, will-executor-try -> will-try-execute, added
 will-execute
MzLib cleanup:
 Removed `@' suffix for embedded units in mzlib:core@ and mzlib@
 Removed all c.ss libraries, plus constan[t].ss
 Removed catch-errors and let-enumerate from macro.ss
 Removed make-class and make-class* from compat.ss
 Removed zsin, zcos, ztan, zasin, zacos, zatan, zlog, zexp,
  and zsqrt from zmath.ss (MzScheme's built-ins do complex)
 Moved from functio.ss to thread.ss: dynamic-disable-break,
  make-single-threader
 Removed from functio.ss: dynamic-wind/protect-break
 Added to thread.ss: dynamic-enable-break
 Moved MzLib's compat.ss out of the core
 Removes all but the first two arguments to pretty-print (the
  rest have parameters, which are more convenient anyway)
 Changed require to reference-file in refer.ss
file.ss library: added make-directory*
pretty-print: default display string handler is now the default
 port display handler instead of the display procedure
Ported to BeOS
Ported to OSKit
Ported to LinuxThreads, sortof; semaphore-waiting threads cannot
 be broken or killed
Inside MzScheme: new built-in type: scheme_complex_izi_type
Inside MzScheme: changed scheme_eval_string to raise an exception
 if the expression returns multiple values, and added
 scheme_eval_string_multi

Version 53, July 25, 1998
Changed file-modify-seconds to file-or-directory-modify-seconds
Changed rename-file to rename-file-or-directory
Changed file procedures to return void on success and raise
 and exception on failure: delete-file, rename-file-or-directory,
 file-size, copy-file, make-directory, delete-directory
Changed the procedures file-or-directory-modify-seconds and 
 file-or-directory-permissions to raise an exception if the
 file/directory does not exist
Changed current-drive to raise exn:misc:unsupported on platforms
 other than Windows
Added find-system-path
Fixed expand-defmacro for initialization argument expressions
 in a class*/names form
Fixed call/ec bug related to dynamic-wind (see !!! in 
 tests/basic.ss)
Fixed dynamic-wind bug: multiple levels of pre-thunks for a
 jump into a continuation were evaluated in reverse order
Fixed atan: second argument is allowed to be an exact non-integer
Fixed equal?: comparisons on equivalent vectors or structs
 with cycles no longer crash (until MzScheme runs out of memory)
Added make-temporary-file to MzLib's file.ss
Changed random and random-seed to use a parameter-specified
 random number generator; the generator is initially
 seeded with a number based on (current-milliseconds)
Removed the obsolete MzLib trigger library
Added with-continuation-mark and current-continuation-marks,
 but these have not yet been documented because their
 semanticses are not yet finalized

Version 52, May 25, 1998
R5RS non-compliance reduced to macros
Added scheme-report-environment, null-environment, and
 interaction-environment
Changed reference-library, etc. to require-library
 and changed require-library, etc. to require-library/proc
Changed uq-ivar and uq-make-gerenric to ivar/proc and 
 make-generic/proc
current-directory is now a parameter
Added simplify-path
Changed execute and execute* to exit via the exit handler
Top-level definitions are no longer allowed in the branches 
 of an if expression; consider replacing an expression like
 (if ... (define x ...)) with 
 (if ... (global-defined-value 'x ...))
expand-defmacro now signals the same set of syntax errors
 as compile and eval
local-expand-defmacro no longer expands define expressions
 in a non-top-level context; to implement a macro that
 detects define forms, use local-expand-body-expression
Fixed bug in (let/ec a (let/ec b (let/cc k ...))); calling
 b then k then a would fail, jumping to b instead of a
Fixed read-eval-print loop when jumping to the continuation
 of a previous eval and raising an exception there before
 the evaluation finishes
regexp-replace and regexp-replace*: \$ ("\\$" in Scheme)
 is now replaced by the empty string; this allows forms
 like "\\0\\$3", which inserts the 1st submatch and "3"
Fixed a potential bug with continuations (although I never
 saw it happen); they need to be marked by the GC with
 interior pointer marking
Changed read-line to break lines only on #\newline by default;
 new optional argument roughly parameterizes over the 
 line-breaking character(s)
Add read-string and read-string! for reading a block
 of characters from a port
Changed MzLib's read-string and read-string-all to
 read-from-string and read-from-string-all
Changed MzLib's with-semaphore to return the value returned
 by the thunk.
Added the command-line macro to MzLib's cmdline.ss
Linux and FreeBSD: turned on support for using more
 than 256 file descriptors
Inside MzScheme: current-directory, now a parameter, no
 longer sets the current directory as managed by the OS
Inside MzScheme: scheme_split_pathname changed
Inside MzScheme: scheme_setcwd and scheme_getcwd renamed to
 scheme_os_setcwd and scheme_os_getcwd; these set and get the
 OS-managed cwd, but they have no effect on the current 
 directory seen by Scheme code

Version 51, March 25, 1998
Changed load/use-compiled: searches for .zo files in
 a "compiled/" subdirectory, and searches for .so/.dll
 files in (build-path "compiled" (system-library-subpath))
Changed load and current-load/default-load-handler: `load'
 now sets the current-load-relative-directory, so a load
 handler does not need to set this parameter
Added current-load-extension (load-extension handler)
Unix: fixed file-or-directory-permissions for group-based 
 permissions when the group is not the current group (but
 still includes the user)
Windows: fixed directory-exists? et al. for UNC paths
Added local-expand-body-expression
Removed input-port-post-semaphore; this procedure can be
 implemented using thread, peek-char, and semaphore-post
Fixed thread: thunk can return any number of values
Fixed custodian-shutdown-all: if it has to shutdown the
 current thread, it does so immediately instead of
 waiting for the next thread context switch
Fixed will executors: will can return multiple values
Added link-exists?
Added copy-file
Added path-list-string->path-list
Added collection-path
The delete-file and rename-file functions now reliably work
 on links rather than the destination of the link (now fixed
 for MacOS and documented this way)
Fixed rename-file: works for directories too, but the
 destination file/directory cannot exist already.
Added a new mode flag for open-output-file et al.:
 'truncate/replace tries 'truncate then 'replace
Changed initial setting of current-library-collection-paths
Unit definitions and embedded definitions are not allowed
 to shadow syntax or macro names; this restriction resolves
 all potential ambiguity resulting from shadowing syntax
Changed display for symbols containg special characters:
 the special characters are not escaped (or bar-quoted)
Changed write to use the value of (read-accept-bar-quote)
 for printing symbols containing special charaters; if
 bar qute reading is off, it is turned off for printing, too
Fixed unit/sig: correctly handles syntax where defintions in 
 the unit shadow syntactic forms
Fixed round of exact rational n/d in the case when (odd? d)
 and (= (remainder n d) (quotient d 2))
Extended exp, sin, cos, tan, log, asin, acons, atan to
 complex numbers; changed sqrt to choose the root with a
 positive real part
Removed rectangular <, >, <=, >= for complex numbers
Changed storage of loaded-library table from built into the
 `require-library' procedure to built into the current
 namespace
Added require-relative-library
Fixed error messages for +, -, etc. to show all arguments
Fixed format, fprintf, and printf: "~~" allowed at the end
 of the format string
Fixed with-handlers: predicate procedures are evaluated
 with the same exception handler as a handler procedure
Added send-event, currently only supported for MacOS
Changed MzLib's pconver.ss libraries; the print-convert-hook@
 unit was removed (along with the pchookr.ss library) and
 replaced with parameters defined in pconverr.ss for similar
 (more powerful) hooks.
Fixed interfaces for compiled-file (.zo) loading across
 MzScheme startups
Fixed bug in ports returned by make-pipe that caused
 spurious eofs
Unused interned symbols are now garbage-collected
Added support for single-precision floating points (turned
 off in default compilation)
Changed read-eval-print-loop, removing its cooperation with
 the default error escape handler; instead, it installs its
 own error escape handler
Improved the support for dynamic extensions that gives an 
 error if an extension is already loaded, or calls a
 reloading function provided by the extension (scheme_reload)
Unix images: removed constraint against using stdio before
 dumps, but images are disabled by default. Also added
 read-image-from-file procedure
MzLib functio.ss: added remv*, remq*, remove*, filter,
 assf, memf, empty, and empty?
MzLib file.ss: added remove-directory/files
MzLib constan.ss: added constant-signature-content macro
MzLib pconver.ss: added whole/fractional-exact-numbers and
 empty-list-name
MzLib pretty.ss: added pretty-print-show-inexactness
MzLib compile.ss: changed the set of compilation flags
Removed begin-expansion-time
Moved begin-elaboration-time from MzLib into MzScheme
Added MzLib library traceld.ss
MacOS: MzScheme always prompts for extra arguments, even if
  a file is dragged onto the application or a launcher program
  starts it
MacOS: Fixed problems with inexact arithmetic: inexact->exact
  for certain negative numbers and miscellaenous inf.0 and
  nan.0 problems
Windows: CYGWIN32 gcc compiler now supported
Inside MzScheme: scheme_setjmp and scheme_longjmp now
 work on values of type mz_jmp_buf instead of jmp_buf
Inside MzScheme: scheme_apply_multi and scheme_apply were
 reversed! (The _ forms where ok.)
Upgraded to gc 4.13alpha1

Version 50, August 26, 1997
Added compile-time inferrence of names for closures, classes,
  and units to improve error messages

Added write-image-to-file for creating heap images of a
  MzScheme program
Fixed reader to disallow . in vectors: #(1 . 2) or #(1 . (3))

Fixed string->number: explicit radix in string can override
  radix argument
Bug fixed in call/cc related to dynamic-wind (see !!! in 
  tests/basic.ss)
Fixed weak hash table's accumulation of hashing buckets
Added 'empty flag for make-namespace
Added two-argument form for global-defined-value

class* syntax changed to accommodate interfaces and removed
  multiple superclasses
uq-ivar always takes two arguments; class is not a legal argument
uq-make-generic accepts a class or an interface
Object system exceptions changed
Added custodian system
Embedded define conventions changed: "regular" defines are only
  allowed in begin expressions and the branches of an if;
  embedded defines can appear in a begin0 expression, but not
  in the first position; defines must all appear at the beginning
  of the block
Contents of a begin expression as an immediate unit or unit/sig 
  expression are promoted to immediate expressions
case supports only R4RS syntax; a single non-list "datum" is
  no longer allowed
Removed catch; use let/ec instead
Removed vector-append
Removed load-with-cd (use load/cd)
Added load/use-compiled

 handler while loading a file) and load-relative (uses the
 parameter for loading a relative filename)
unit/sig's include form is like load-relative instead of load/cd
require-library uses load or load/use-compiled instead of load/cd
Windows: expand-path does not put a drive on a driveless path
  anymore; use path->complete-path instead
compile-file moved out of MzScheme into MzLib "compile.ss"; now 
  takes a single flag list argument instead of two final Booleans
current-base-parameterization parameter replaced with 
  parameterization-branch-handler parameter
Parameterizations support sharing (in addition to defaulting);
  see docs for make-parameterization-with-sharing
Added print, port print handlers, and a global port print handler
Changed the default print handler to use print instead of write
Fixed bug in ports returned by make-pipe
Fixed bug in dynamic-wind; continuation jumps into the pre-thunk
  had a non-intuitive semantics; the correct semantics is now 
  implemented and documented (also for jumps with the post-thunk)
Changed time-apply to always return a list as its first return
  value; time form can return multiple values for its expressions
format, fprintf, and printf are case-insensitive for ~ directives;
  added ~v, ~e, ~<whitespace>
Added semaphore-wait/enable-break
Added thread-running? and thread-wait
Fixed bug in threads and timed sleeping
Fixed bug in breaking a blocked thread
Fixed bug in continuations returning multiple values through a
  dynamic-wind (multiple return values could be corrupted)
Fixed arity reporting for continuations
Fixed Windows system* and read from console stdin and process*
  ports: MzScheme threads no longer blocked; ctl-c breaking works
  in stand-alone console MzScheme
process and process* now return a list of 5 values (instead of 4)
map, for-each, andmap, and ormap raise exn:application:map-arity
 when the procedure's arity does not match the number of supplied
 lists; note that (map (lambda () 10) null) now signals an error
list-ref and list-tail accept arbitrarily large indices
Type for indices changed: must be an exact integer (matches R4RS better)
  affects make-vector, vector-ref, vector-set!, make-string, string-ref, 
  string-set!, substring, and struct-ref
make-namespace's '[no-]set!-undefined and '[no-]auto-else flags
  removed; replaced with two new parameters: 
  compile-allow-set!-undefined and compile-allow-cond-fallthrough
Fixed in units: (define x y) (define y 0) x => #<undefined> instead of 
  #<void>
exn:struct's super-type field renamed struct-type for consistency
exn:i/o:filesystem:filename split into exn:i/o:filesystem:path
  and exn:i/o:filesystem:file; username exception moved under path
Unix: system no longer blocks other MzScheme threads
Unix: processes created by process and process* are not zombies forever, 
  anymore. (The SIGCHLD signal is handled appropriately.)
MacOS: dynamic extension suopport via CFM (PPC only in the distributed
  applications from PLT)
Windows: removed attempted fix for thread-blocking problem 
  when reading stdin from console
Fixed auto-flush of stdout for read of stdin
Fixed <, >, <=, >= for certain exact rational number comparisons
Fixed inexact->exact for negative inexact numbers (fractional part
  was added to the resulting number with the wrong sign)
Fixed rational? to answer #t for inexact numbers
Fixed odd?, even?, and trig functions for +inf.0 and -inf.0
Fixed handling of +nan.0 by many math routines; fixed +nan.0 for
  everything under Windows
Added R4RS rationalize
compound-unit/sig export var clause syntax now matches documentation

Inside MzScheme: changed class/object toolbox, added custodian
  toolbox
Upgraded to gc 4.11

Version 48: Skipped to avoid confusion with Scheme48

Version 47, January 11, 1997
WARNING: multiple inhertance is going away in the next version or so
Added will executors
pretty-print-print-hook and pretty-print-size-hook now take
 three arguments: value display? port
file-position can return the current position for any port
Fixed errors reading floating-point constants due to system
 library bugs:
   Linux: strtod("0e...", ...) quits looking after "0"
   SunOS/Solaris: strtod(".3e2666666666") returned 0.0
   HP/UX: strtod(".3e2666666666") fails
Windows: fixed thread-blocking problem for reading stdin from console
Insize MzScheme: when working with "fd_set" values, use
  MZ_FD_ZERO, MZ_FD_SET, MZ_FD_CLR, MZ_FD_ISSET; use 
  scheme_get_fdset() to get the second or third fd_set in an array;
  routines for thread-blocking are now documented in "Inside MzScheme"

Version 46, December 5, 1996
unit/sig macros moved out of MzLib and into core MzScheme; 
  (require-library "unitsig.ss") is obsolete, but still supported
  as a no-op
Unit signature matching is now position-independent, and the error
  messages are better
Removed obsolete install-unit-with-signature
(begin) or (begin0) is now a syntax error
Changed class* syntax so that an explicit name for `this' is provided
MzLib's class-asi* changed to class*-asi, while adding new `this' id
Prettier(?) printing for prims like >: #<|primitive:>|>
invoke-open-unit w/o path/prefix is now the same as #f instead of ();
  the path form will probably be phased out in a future release
quasiquote syntax changed slightly
stdout/stderr are not auto-flushed for read-char or peek-char on stdin
 (still flushed by read and read-line)
Added port-display-handler and port-write-handler

Version 45, November 12, 1996
Multiple return values are aggressively supported
IMPORTANT: let-values is now analogous to let; the old 
  let-values is now let*-values
let-values, letrec-values, define-values, and begin0 are primitive
define-struct and let-struct expand to new struct form
Added thread-savy parameterization system; namespace system changed
pipe changed to make-pipe, returns 2 values
Case-sensitivity for the reader is a settable parameter
Reading [] and {} as parens is a settable parameter
