;; A port lock implies uninterruptable mode, but not necessarily
;; atomic mode --- and an upgrade to atomic mode is not allowed. Also,
;; beware that a port lock is not reentrant. Since port locks have no
;; order, only one port lock can be taken at a time. It's fine to take
;; a port lock in atomic mode, though.
;;
;; A port can be in a state where a port lock implies atomic mode.
;; That state is needed for progress evts in an input port, since
;; progress synchronization involves the thread scheduler.
;;
;; Possble `(core-port-lock p)` values for a port `p`:
;;  - #f: lock is available, atomic mode not required [fast path]
;;  - #t: lock is taken, atomic mode not required, uncontended [fast path]
;;  - 'atomic: lock is available, but must be take in atomic mode
;;  - 'to-atomic: lock is taken, atomic mode required in future, uncontended
;;  - 'in-atomic: lock is taken, atomic mode was and remains required, uncontended
;;  - `lock` record: general case for contended, uses host-supplied synchronization
;; A port lock can go from atomic mode to non-atomic mode while being held (as
;; decided by the thread holding the lock), but it can go from contended to
;; uncontended without the lock holder's decision, obviously.
;; When a lock goes from uncontended to contended, it stays contentded.
;; So, these are the possible transitions:
;;
;;   *uncontended, non-atomic*               *uncontended, atomic*
;;         {#f, #t}             <---->   {'atomic, 'in-atomic, 'to-atomic}
;;
;;            |                                  |
;;            v                                  V
;;
;;     (lock #f ....)           <---->       (lock #t ....)
;;    *contended, non-atomic*              *contended,atomic*
;;
;; Port locks are unordered. If you need to take multiple of then (as
;; `subprocess` does), then set them to atomic mode, and take them only
;; after entering atomic mode (at which point the order won't matter).
;; Port locks are order *before* the rktio lock.
