/*
   The "cstartup.inc" file is not, as distributed, compatible with
   omissions from or additions to the set of built-in identifiers.
   The reason is that the "cstartup.inc" file is a ".zo" version of the
   "startup.inc" files, and the ".zo" format changes when the set of
   built-in names changes (because indices assigned to the built-in
   names shift).

   If you make a version with omissions or additions, set
   USE_COMPILED_STARTUP to 0 and change the version at
   "../version/racket_version.h"; then, `make cgc' and then `make
   cstartup' to create "cstartup.inc"; finally, set
   EXPECTED_PRIM_COUNT to the right value and USE_COMPILED_STARTUP to
   1 and `make' again. */
