Racket is distributed under the MIT license and the Apache version 2.0
license, at your option. However, the Racket runtime system includes
components distributed under other licenses. In short:

  * The Racket CS runtime system embeds Chez Scheme, which is
    distributed under the Apache version 2.0 license. This runtime
    system is built from code in racket/src/cs and
    racket/src/ChezScheme.

  * The Racket BC runtime system includes code distributed under the
    GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3. This runtime system
    is built from code in racket/src/racket.

Except for Windows executables that are created with the "embed DLLs"
option, the runtime system remains separate as a shared library or
additional executable, which means that it is dynamically linked and
can be replaced with a modified variant by users.

See the file LICENSE-LGPL.txt for the full text of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.

See the file LICENSE-APACHE.txt for the full text of the
Apache version 2.0 license.

See the file LICENSE-MIT.txt for the full text of the

Additionally, the default mode of building Racket will install other
packages, which are distributed under their own license. In the
default mode, all of those packages are distributed under the licenses
listed above.
