# This makefile template is instantiated in a build directory to
# communicate configuration decisions from "configure" to "build.zuo".
# Most variables here are optional, so a "Makefile" could be created
# directly (such as by "winfig.bat"). The main required ones are
# `srcdir` and `MACH`. For non-Windows, `bindir`, `libdir`, etc., are
# also required. `OSX` is required for Mac OS (and not `--enable-xonx`).
