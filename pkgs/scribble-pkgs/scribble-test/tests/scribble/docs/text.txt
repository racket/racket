Document

This document exercises various constructs to check text output.

1. Part A

Scribble is a collection of tools for creating prose documents—papers,
books, library documentation, etc.—in HTML or PDF (via Latex) form. More
generally, Scribble helps you write programs that are rich in textual
content, whether the content is prose to be typeset or any other form of
text to be generated programmatically.

1.1. A Subsection

Here’s some Racket code:

  (define half (lambda (x)
                 (x x)))  
  (x x)                   

1.2. Another Subsection

 (require racket/base) package: base

(cons car cdr) -> stuff?
  car : (or/c #f        
              other?)   
  cdr : any?            

Ok?

2. B

* Run

    scribble --pdf mouse.scrbl

  to generate PDF as "mouse.pdf". This will work only if you have
  pdflatex installed. If you’d like to see the intermediate Latex, try

    scribble --latex mouse.scrbl

  to generate "mouse.tex".

* Run

    scribble --html mouse.scrbl

  to generate HTML as "mouse.html".  You may notice that the apostrophe
  in “he’s” turned into a curly apostrophe.

* Run

    scribble --htmls mouse.scrbl

  to generate HTML as "mouse/index.html". Sub-sections (which we add
  next) will appear as separate HTML files in the "mouse" directory.

Run the scribble command(s) from the old section again. You may notice
the curly double-quotes in the output, and the --- turned into an em
dash.

3. C

3.1. Inside C

Section C had no text before its subsections.

3.2. Inside C, Again

But the subsections have text.
