@guideintro["hash-tables"]{hash tables}

A @deftech{hash table} (or simply @deftech{hash}) maps each of its
keys to a single value. For a given hash table, keys are equivalent
via @racket[equal?], @racket[equal-always?], @racket[eqv?], or
@racket[eq?], and keys are retained either strongly, weakly
(see @secref["weakbox"]), or like @tech{ephemerons}.
A hash table is also either mutable or immutable.
Immutable hash tables support effectively constant-time access and
update, just like mutable hash tables; the constant on immutable
operations is usually larger, but the functional nature of immutable
hash tables can pay off in certain algorithms. Use @racket[immutable?]
to check whether a hash table is immutable.

@margin-note{Immutable hash tables actually provide @math{O(log N)}
access and update (where the base of the @math{log} is 32).
Since @math{N} is limited by the address space so
that @math{log N} is limited to less than 7 or 13 (depending on the
platform), @math{log N} can be treated reasonably as a constant.}

For @racket[equal?]-based hashing, the built-in hash functions on
@tech{strings}, @tech{pairs}, @tech{lists}, @tech{vectors},
@tech{prefab} or transparent @tech{structures}, @|etc|, take time
proportional to the size of the value. The hash code for a compound
data structure, such as a list or vector, depends on hashing each item
of the container, but the depth of such recursive hashing is
limited (to avoid potential problems with cyclic data). For a
non-@tech{list} @tech{pair}, both @racket[car] and @racket[cdr]
hashing is treated as a deeper hash, but the @racket[cdr] of a
@tech{list} is treated as having the same hashing depth as the list.

A hash table can be used as a two-valued @tech{sequence} (see
@secref["sequences"]). The keys and values of the hash table serve as
elements of the sequence (i.e., each element is a key and its
associated value). If a mapping is added to or removed from a mutable hash
table during iteration, then an iteration step may fail with
@racket[exn:fail:contract], or the iteration may skip or duplicate
keys and values.  See also @racket[in-hash], @racket[in-hash-keys],
@racket[in-hash-values], and @racket[in-hash-pairs].

Two hash tables cannot be @racket[equal?] unless they have the same
mutability, use the same key-comparison procedure (@racket[equal?],
@racket[equal-always?], @racket[eqv?], or @racket[eq?]), both hold
keys strongly, weakly, or like @tech{ephemerons}.
Empty immutable hash tables are @racket[eq?]
when they are @racket[equal?].

@history[#:changed "7.2.0.9" @elem{Made empty immutable hash tables
                                   @racket[eq?] when they are

@elemtag['(caveat "concurrency")]{@bold{Caveats concerning concurrent
modification:}} A mutable hash table can be manipulated with
@racket[hash-ref], @racket[hash-set!], and @racket[hash-remove!]
concurrently by multiple threads, and the operations are protected by
a table-specific semaphore as needed. Several caveats apply, however:

 @itemize[

  @item{If a thread is terminated while applying @racket[hash-ref],
  @racket[hash-ref-key], @racket[hash-set!], @racket[hash-remove!],
  @racket[hash-ref!], @racket[hash-update!], or @racket[hash-clear!]
  to a hash table that
  uses @racket[equal?], @racket[equal-always?], or @racket[eqv?] key
  comparisons, all current and future operations on the hash table may
  block indefinitely.}

  @item{The @racket[hash-map], @racket[hash-for-each], and @racket[hash-clear!] procedures do
  not use the table's semaphore to guard the traversal as a whole
  (if a traversal is needed, in the case of @racket[hash-clear!]).
  Changes by one thread to a hash table can affect the keys and values
  seen by another thread part-way through its traversal of the same
  hash table.}

 @item{The @racket[hash-update!] and @racket[hash-ref!] functions 
 use a table's semaphore
 independently for the @racket[hash-ref] and @racket[hash-set!] parts
 of their functionality, which means that the update as a whole is not
 ``atomic.''}

 @item{Adding a mutable hash table as a key in itself is trouble on
  the grounds that the key is being mutated (see the caveat below),
  but it is also a kind of concurrent use of the hash table: computing
  a hash table's hash code may require waiting on the table's
  semaphore, but the semaphore is already held for modifying the hash
  table, so the hash-table addition can block indefinitely.}

Like @racket[make-hash], @racket[make-hasheq],

Beware that values in a weak hash table are retained normally. If a value in
the table refers back to its key, then the table will retain the value
and therefore the key; the mapping will never be removed from the
table even if the key becomes otherwise inaccessible. To avoid that
problem, use an ephemeron hash table as created by
@racket[make-ephemeron-hash], @racket[make-ephemeron-hashalw],
@racket[make-ephemeron-hasheqv], or @racket[make-ephemeron-hasheq].
For values that do not refer to keys,
there is a modest extra cost to using an ephemeron hash table instead
of a weak hash table, but prefer an ephemeron hash table when in
doubt.

Using an ephemeron hash table is like using a weak hash table and
mapping each key to a @tech{ephemeron} that pairs the key and value.
An advantage of an ephemeron hash table is that the value need not be
extracted with @racket[ephemeron-value] from the result of functions
like @racket[hash-ref]. An ephemeron hash table might also be
represented more compactly than a weak hash table with explicit
@tech{ephemeron} values.

Returns the key held by @racket[ht] that is equivalent to @racket[key]

then @racket[failure-result] is used as in @racket[hash-ref] to determine
the result.

If @racket[ht] is not an @tech{impersonator}, then the returned key,
assuming it is found, will be @racket[eq?]-equivalent to the one
actually retained by @racket[ht]:

@examples[
#:eval the-eval

If a mutable hash is updated multiple times using keys that are
not @racket[eq?]-equivalent but are equivalent according to the
hash's key-comparison procedure, the hash retains the first one:

@examples[
#:eval the-eval
(define original-key "hello")
(define key-copy (string-copy original-key))

(define table (make-hash))
(hash-set! table original-key 'one)
(hash-set! table key-copy 'two)

(eq? (hash-ref-key table "hello") original-key)
(eq? (hash-ref-key table "hello") key-copy)
]

Conversely, an immutable hash retains the key that was most-recently
used to update it:
@examples[
#:eval the-eval
(define original-key "hello")
(define key-copy (string-copy original-key))

(define table0 (hash))
(define table1 (hash-set table0 original-key 'one))
(define table2 (hash-set table1 key-copy 'two))

(eq? (hash-ref-key table2 "hello") original-key)
(eq? (hash-ref-key table2 "hello") key-copy)
]

If @racket[ht] is an @tech{impersonator}, then the returned key
will be determined as described in the documentation to
@racket[impersonate-hash].

@racket[hash-for-each] traversal is in process, arbitrary key--value
pairs can be dropped or duplicated in the traversal. Key mappings can
be deleted or remapped (by any thread) with no adverse affects; the
change does not affect a traversal if the key has been seen already,
otherwise the traversal skips a deleted key or uses the remapped key's
new value.

@defproc[(hash-filter-values [ht hash?] [pred procedure?])
         hash?]{

Filters the @racket[hash?] @racket[ht] based on a predicate
@racket[pred] applied to its values.  This function returns a new hash
table containing only the key-value pairs for which the predicate
@racket[pred] returns true when applied to the values of @racket[ht].
The resulting hash table retains the mutability and the key comparison
predicate (e.g., @racket[eq?], @racket[eqv?], @racket[equal-always?],
@racket[equal?]) of the input hash table @racket[ht].
