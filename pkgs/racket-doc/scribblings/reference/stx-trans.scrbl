@defthing[prop:set!-transformer struct-type-property?]{

A @tech{structure type property} to identify structure types that act
as @tech{assignment transformers} like the ones created by
@racket[make-set!-transformer].

The property value must be an exact integer or procedure of one or two
arguments. In the former case, the integer designates a field within
the structure that should contain a procedure; the integer must be
between @racket[0] (inclusive) and the number of non-automatic fields
in the structure type (exclusive, not counting supertype fields), and
the designated field must also be specified as immutable.

If the property value is a procedure of one argument, then the
procedure serves as a @tech{syntax transformer} and for @racket[set!]
transformations. If the property value is a procedure of two
arguments, then the first argument is the structure whose type has
@racket[prop:set!-transformer] property, and the second argument is a
syntax object as for a @tech{syntax transformer} and for @racket[set!]
transformations; @racket[set!-transformer-procedure] applied to the
structure produces a new function that accepts just the syntax object
and calls the procedure associated through the property. Finally, if the
property value is an integer, the target identifier is extracted from
the structure instance; if the field value is not a procedure of one
argument, then a procedure that always calls
@racket[raise-syntax-error] is used, instead.

If a value has both the @racket[prop:set!-transformer] and
@racket[prop:rename-transformer] properties, then the latter takes
precedence. If a structure type has the @racket[prop:set!-transformer]
and @racket[prop:procedure] properties, then the former takes
precedence for the purposes of macro expansion.}

@defthing[prop:rename-transformer struct-type-property?]{

A @tech{structure type property} to identify structure types that act
as @tech{rename transformers} like the ones created by
@racket[make-rename-transformer].

The property value must be an exact integer, an identifier
@tech{syntax object}, or a procedure that takes one argument.
In the former case, the integer designates a
field within the structure that should contain an identifier; the
integer must be between @racket[0] (inclusive) and the number of
non-automatic fields in the structure type (exclusive, not counting

If the property value is an identifier, the identifier serves as the
target for renaming, just like the first argument to
@racket[make-rename-transformer]. If the property value is an integer,
the target identifier is extracted from the structure instance; if the
field value is not an identifier, then an identifier @racketidfont{?}
with an empty context is used, instead.

If the property value is a procedure that takes one argument, then the
procedure is called to obtain the identifier that the rename
transformer will use as a target identifier. The returned identifier
should probably have the @racket['not-free-identifier=?] syntax
property. If the procedure returns any value that is not an
identifier, the @racket[exn:fail:contract] exception is raised.

Expands @racket[stx] in the lexical context of the expression
currently being expanded. The @racket[context-v] argument is used as
the result of @racket[syntax-local-context] for immediate expansions;
a list indicates an @tech{internal-definition context}, and more
information on the form of the list is below. If @racket[stx] is not
already a @tech{syntax object}, it is coerced with
@racket[(datum->syntax #f stx)] before expansion.

The @racket[stop-ids] argument controls how far @racket[local-expand] expands @racket[stx]:

@itemlist[
 @item{If @racket[stop-ids] is an empty list, then @racket[stx] is recursively expanded (i.e.
       expansion proceeds to sub-expressions). The result is guaranteed to be a fully-expanded form,
       which can include the bindings listed in @secref["fully-expanded"], plus @racket[#%expression]
       in any expression position.}

 @item{If @racket[stop-ids] is a list containing just @racket[module*], then expansion proceeds as if
       @racket[stop-ids] were an empty list, except that expansion does not recur to @tech{submodules}
       defined with @racket[module*] (which are left unexpanded in the result).}

 @item{If @racket[stop-ids] is any other list, then @racket[begin], @racket[quote], @racket[set!],
       @racket[#%plain-lambda], @racket[case-lambda], @racket[let-values], @racket[letrec-values],
       @racket[if], @racket[begin0], @racket[with-continuation-mark], @racket[letrec-syntaxes+values],
       @racket[#%plain-app], @racket[#%expression], @racket[#%top], and @racket[#%variable-reference]
       are implicitly added to @racket[stop-ids]. Expansion proceeds recursively, stopping when the
       expander encounters any of the forms in @racket[stop-ids], and the result is the
       partially-expanded form.

       When the expander would normally implicitly introduce a @racketid[#%app], @racketid[#%datum],
       or @racketid[#%top] identifier as described in @secref["expand-steps"], it checks to see if an
       identifier with the same @tech{binding} as the one to be introduced appears in
       @racket[stop-ids]. If so, the identifier is @emph{not} introduced; the result of expansion is
       the bare application, literal data expression, or unbound identifier rather than one wrapped in
       the respective explicit form.

       When @racket[#%plain-module-begin] is not in @racket[stop-ids], the
       @racket[#%plain-module-begin] transformer detects and expands sub-forms (such as
       @racket[define-values]) regardless of the identifiers presence in @racket[stop-ids].

       Expansion does not replace the scopes in a local-variable
       reference to match the binding identifier.}

 @item{If @racket[stop-ids] is @racket[#f] instead of a list, then @racket[stx] is expanded only as
       long as the outermost form of @racket[stx] is a macro (i.e. expansion does @emph{not} proceed
       to sub-expressions, and it does not replace the scopes in a local-variable reference to match the
       binding identifier). The @racketid[#%app], @racketid[#%datum], and @racketid[#%top] identifiers are
       never introduced.}]

Independent of @racket[stop-ids], when @racket[local-expand] encounters an identifier that has a local
binding but no binding in the current expansion context, the variable is left as-is (as opposed to
triggering an ``out of context'' syntax error).

When @racket[context-v] is @racket['module-begin], and the result of
expansion is a @racket[#%plain-module-begin] form, then a
@racket['submodule] @tech{syntax property} is added to each enclosed
@racket[module] form (but not @racket[module*] forms) in the same way as by
@racket[module] expansion.

If the @racket[intdef-ctx] argument is an internal-definition context, its @tech{bindings} and
@tech{bindings} from all @tech{parent internal-definition contexts} are added to the
@tech{local binding context} during the dynamic extent of the call to @racket[local-expand].
Additionally, unless @racket[#f] was provided for the @racket[_add-scope?] argument to
@racket[syntax-local-make-definition-context] when the internal-definition context was created,
its @tech{inside-edge scope} (but @emph{not} the scopes of any @tech{parent internal-definition contexts}) is
added to the @tech{lexical information} for both @racket[stx] prior to its expansion and the expansion
result (because the expansion might introduce bindings or references to internal-definition bindings).

For backwards compatibility, when @racket[intdef-ctx] is a list all @tech{bindings} from all of the provided internal-definition
contexts and their parents are added to the @tech{local binding context}, and the @tech{inside-edge scope} from
each context for which @racket[_add-scope?] was not @racket[#f] is added in the same way.

Expansion records @tech{use-site scopes} for removal from definition bindings. When the
@racket[intdef-ctx] argument is an internal-definition context, use-site scopes are recorded
with that context. When @racket[intdef-ctx] is @racket[#f] or (for backwards compatibility) a list,
use-site scopes are recorded with the current expand context.

For a particular @tech{internal-definition context}, generate a unique
value and put it into a list for @racket[context-v]. To allow
@tech{liberal expansion} of @racket[define] forms, the generated value
should be an instance of a structure with a true value for
@racket[prop:liberal-define-context]. If the internal-definition
context is meant to be self-contained, the list for @racket[context-v]
should contain only the generated value; if the internal-definition
context is meant to splice into an immediately enclosing context, then
when @racket[syntax-local-context] produces a list, @racket[cons] the
generated value onto that list.

When expressions are expanded via @racket[local-expand] with an
internal-definition context @racket[intdef-ctx], and when the expanded
expressions are incorporated into an overall form @racket[_new-stx],
then typically @racket[internal-definition-context-track] should be
applied to @racket[intdef-ctx] and @racket[_new-stx] to provide
expansion history to external tools.

Like @racket[local-expand] given @racket['expression] and an empty
stop list, but with two results: a syntax object for the fully
expanded expression, and a syntax object whose content is opaque.

The latter can be used in place of the former (perhaps in a larger
expression produced by a macro transformer), and when the macro
expander encounters the opaque object, it substitutes the fully
expanded expression without re-expanding it; the
@exnraise[exn:fail:syntax] if the expansion context includes
@tech{scopes} that were not present for the original expansion, in
which case re-expansion might produce different results. Consistent
use of @racket[syntax-local-expand-expression] and the opaque object
thus avoids quadratic expansion times when local expansions are
nested.

If @racket[opaque-only?] is true, then the first result is @racket[#f]
instead of the expanded expression. Obtaining only the second, opaque
result can be more efficient in some expansion contexts.

Unlike @racket[local-expand], @racket[syntax-local-expand-expression]
normally produces an expanded expression that contains no
@racket[#%expression] forms. However, if
@racket[syntax-local-expand-expression] is used within an expansion

         internal-definition-context?]{

Creates an opaque @tech{internal-definition context} value to be used with @racket[local-expand] and
other functions. A transformer should create one context for each set of internal definitions to be
expanded.

Before expanding forms whose lexical context should include the definitions, the transformer
should use @racket[internal-definition-context-add-scopes] to apply the context's scopes to the syntax.
Calls to procedures such as @racket[local-expand] to expand the forms should
provide the @tech{internal-definition context} value as an argument.

After discovering an internal @racket[define-values] or @racket[define-syntaxes] form, use
@racket[syntax-local-bind-syntaxes] to add @tech{bindings} to the context.

An @tech{internal-definition context} internally creates an @tech{outside-edge
scope} and an @tech{inside-edge scope} to represent the context. The
@tech{inside-edge scope} is added to any form that is expanded within the
context or that appears as the result of a (partial) expansion within the
context.  For backward compatibility, providing @racket[#f] for
@racket[add-scope?] disables this behavior.

If @racket[parent-ctx] is not @racket[#f], then @racket[parent-ctx] is made the @deftech{parent
internal-definition context} for the new internal-definition context. Whenever the new contextâs
@tech{bindings} are added to the @tech{local binding context} (e.g. by providing the context to
@racket[local-expand], @racket[syntax-local-bind-syntaxes], or @racket[syntax-local-value]), then the
bindings from @racket[parent-ctx] are also added as well. If @racket[parent-ctx] was also created with a
@tech{parent internal-definition context}, @tech{bindings} from its parent are also added, and so on
recursively. Note that the @tech{scopes} of parent contexts are @emph{not} added implicitly, only the
@tech{bindings}, even when the @tech{inside-edge scope} of the child context would be implicitly added. If the
@tech{scopes} of parent definition contexts should be added, the parent contexts must be provided
explicitly.

Additionally, if the created definition context is intended to be spliced into a surrounding
definition context, the surrounding context should always be provided for the @racket[parent-ctx]
argument to ensure the necessary @tech{use-site scopes} are added to macros expanded in the context.
Otherwise, expansion of nested definitions can be inconsistent with the expansion of definitions in
the surrounding context.

An @tech{internal-definition context} also tracks @tech{use-site scopes} created during expansion
within the definition context, so that they can be removed from bindings created in the context,
at @racket[syntax-local-identifier-as-binding], and at @racket[internal-definition-context-splice-binding-identifier].

The scopes associated with a new definition context are pruned from
@racket[quote-syntax] forms only when it is created during the dynamic
extent of a @tech{syntax transformer} application or in a
@racket[begin-for-syntax] form (potentially nested) within a module
being expanded.

@defthing[prop:expansion-contexts struct-type-property?]{

A @tech{structure type property} to constrain the use of macro

value must be a list of symbols, where the allowed symbols are
@racket['expression], @racket['top-level], @racket['module],
@racket['module-begin], and @racket['definition-context]. Each symbol
corresponds to an expansion context in the same way as for
@racket[local-expand] or as reported by @racket[syntax-local-context],
except that @racket['definition-context] is used (instead of a list)
to represent an @tech{internal-definition context}.

If an identifier is bound to a transformer whose list does not include
a symbol for a particular use of the identifier, then the use is
adjusted as follows:
@;
@itemlist[

 @item{In a @racket['module-begin] context, then the use is wrapped in
       a @racket[begin] form.}

 @item{In a @racket['module], @racket['top-level],
       @racket['internal-definition] or context, if
       @racket['expression] is present in the list, then the use is
       wrapped in an @racket[#%expression] form.}

 @item{Otherwise, a syntax error is reported.}

]

The @racket[prop:expansion-contexts] property is most useful in
combination with @racket[prop:rename-transformer], since a general
@tech{transformer} procedure can use @racket[syntax-local-context].
Furthermore, a @racket[prop:expansion-contexts] property makes the
most sense when a @tech{rename transformer}'s identifier has the
@racket['not-free-identifier=?] property, otherwise a definition of
the binding creates a binding alias that effectively routes around the
@racket[prop:expansion-contexts] property.

Returns an indication of the context for expansion that triggered a
@tech{syntax transformer} call. See @secref["expand-context-model"]
for more information on contexts.

The symbol results indicate that the expression is being expanded for
an @tech{expression context}, a @tech{top-level context}, a
@tech{module context}, or a @tech{module-begin context}.

A list result indicates expansion in an @tech{internal-definition
context}. The identity of the list's first element (i.e., its
@racket[eq?]ness) reflects the identity of the internal-definition
context; in particular two transformer expansions receive the same
first value if and only if they are invoked for the same
@tech{internal-definition context}. Later values in the list similarly
identify @tech{internal-definition contexts} that are still being expanded,
and that required the expansion of nested internal-definition
contexts.

Like @racket[make-syntax-introducer], but the encapsulated @tech{scope} is an @deftech{interned scope}. Multiple calls to
@racket[make-interned-syntax-introducer] with the same @racket[key] will produce procedures that flip,
add, or remove the same scope, even across @tech{phases} and module @tech{instantiations}.
Furthermore, the scope remains consistent even when embedded in @tech{compiled} code, so a scope

Unlike @racket[make-syntax-introducer], the scope added by a procedure created with

A @racket[#f] value for @racket[base-stx] is equivalent to a syntax

This procedure is potentially useful when some @racket[_m-id] has a
transformer binding that records some @racket[_orig-id], and a use of
@racket[_m-id] introduces a binding of @racket[_orig-id]. In that
case, the @tech{scopes} one the use of @racket[_m-id] added since the
binding of @racket[_m-id] should be transferred to the binding
instance of @racket[_orig-id], so that it captures uses with the same

A @tech{transformer} binding whose value is a structure with the

@racket[_provide-spec] for @racket[provide] as a @deftech{provide transformer}.
A @tech{provide transformer} is applied as part of the last phase of
a module's expansion, after all other declarations and expressions within
the module are expanded.

A @tech{transformer} binding whose value is a structure with the
@racket[prop:provide-pre-transformer] property implements a derived
@racket[_provide-spec] for @racket[provide] as a @deftech{provide
pre-transformer}.  A @tech{provide pre-transformer} is applied as part
of the first phase of a module's expansion. Since it is used in the
first phase, a @tech{provide pre-transformer} can use functions such
as @racket[syntax-local-lift-expression] to introduce expressions and
definitions in the enclosing module.

An identifier can have a @tech{transformer} binding to a value that
acts both as a @tech{provide transformer} and @tech{provide
pre-transformer}. The result of a @tech{provide
pre-transformer} is @emph{not} automatically re-expanded, so a
@tech{provide pre-transformer} can usefully expand to itself in that case.

A transformer is called with the syntax object representing its use as
a @racket[_provide-spec] within a @racket[provide] form and a list of
symbols representing the export modes specified by enclosing
@racket[_provide-spec]s. The result of a @tech{provide transformer}
must be a list of @racket[export]s, while the result of a
@tech{provide pre-transformer} is a syntax object to be used as a
@racket[_provide-spec] in the last phase of module expansion.

If a derived form contains a sub-form that is a
@racket[_provide-spec], then it can call @racket[expand-export] or
@racket[pre-expand-export] to transform the sub-@racket[_provide-spec]
sub-form.

See also @racket[define-provide-syntax], which supports macro-style
@tech{provide transformers}.


@defproc[(expand-export [provide-spec syntax?] [modes (listof phase+space?)])
         (listof export?)]{

Expands the given @racket[_provide-spec] to a list of exports. The
@racket[modes] list controls the expansion of
sub-@racket[_provide-specs]; for example, an identifier refers to a
binding in the @tech{phase level} of the enclosing @racket[provide]
form, unless the @racket[modes] list specifies otherwise. Normally,
@racket[modes] is either empty or contains a single element.

@defproc[(pre-expand-export [provide-spec syntax?] [modes (listof phase+space?)])

Expands the given @racket[_provide-spec] at the level of @tech{provide

Reports the value of a syntax property that can be
attached to an identifier by the expansion of a keyword-application
form. See @racket[lambda] for more
information about the property.

The property value is normally a pair consisting of the original
identifier and an identifier that appears in the
expansion. Property-value merging via @racket[syntax-track-origin] can make
the value a pair of such values, and so on.}

@section[#:tag "portal-syntax"]{Portal Syntax Bindings}

An identifier bound to @deftech{portal syntax} value created by
@racket[make-portal-syntax] does not act as a transformer, but it
encapsulates a syntax object that can be accessed and inspected even
without instantiating the enclosing module. Portal syntax is also bound
using the @racketidfont{portal} form of @racket[#%require].

@defproc[(portal-syntax? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a value created by
