suitable expression context at the @tech{phase level} indicated by

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[a-id] and @racket[b-id] access the same

@racket[a-phase-level] or @racket[b-phase-level] corresponds to the
@tech{label phase level}.

``Same module binding'' means that the identifiers refer to the same
original definition site, and not necessarily to the same
@racket[require] or @racket[provide] site. Due to renaming in
@racket[require] and @racket[provide], or due to a transformer binding
to a @tech{rename transformer}, the identifiers may return distinct
results with @racket[syntax-e].

        @itemize[

        @item{@racket[_from-mod] is a module path index (see
        @secref["modpathidx"]) that indicates the defining module. It
        is the ``self'' module path index if the binding refers to a
        definition in the enclosing module of @racket[id-stx].}

        @item{@racket[_from-sym] is a symbol for the identifier's name
        at its definition site in the originating module. This can be
        different from the local name returned by
        @racket[syntax->datum] for several reasons: the identifier is
        renamed on import, it is renamed on export, or it is
        implicitly renamed because the binding site was generated by a
        macro invocation. In that last case, it may be an
        @tech{unreadable symbol}, and it may be different from the
        result of @racket[syntax->datum] on the identifier in the
        original source definition.}

        @item{@racket[_nominal-from-mod] is a module path index (see
        @secref["modpathidx"]) that indicates the binding's module as
        it appears locally in the source around @racket[id-stx]: it
        indicates a module @racket[require]d into the context of
        @racket[id-stx] to provide its binding, or it is the same
        ``self'' as @racket[_from-mod] for a binding that refers to a
        definition in the enclosing module of @racket[id-stx]. It can
        be different from @racket[_from-mod] due to a re-export in
        @racket[_nominal-from-mod] of some imported identifier. If the
        same binding is imported in multiple ways, an arbitrary
        representative is chosen.}

        @item{@racket[_nominal-from-sym] is a symbol for the binding's
        identifier as it appears locally in the source around
        @racket[id-stx]: it is the identifier's name as exported by
        @racket[_nominal-from-mod], or it is the source identifier's
        symbol for a definition within the enclosing module of
        @racket[id-stx]. It can be different from @racket[_from-sym]
        due to a renaming @racket[provide], even if @racket[_from-mod]
        and @racket[_nominal-from-mod] are the same, or due to a
        definition that was introduced by a macro expansion.}

        @item{@racket[_from-phase] is an exact non-negative integer
        representing the originating phase. For example, it is
        @racket[1] if the definition is for-syntax.}

        @item{@racket[_import-phase+space-shift] is @racket[0] if the binding
        import of @racket[_nominal-from-mode] is from a definition
        or a plain @racket[require], @racket[1] if it is from a
        @racket[for-syntax] import, a phase combined with a space name if it
        is from a @racket[for-space] import, etc.}

        @item{@racket[_nominal-export-phase+space] is the @tech{phase level}
        and @tech{binding space}
        of the export from @racket[_nominal-from-mod] for an
        imported binding, or it is the phase level of the definition for a
        binding from the enclosing module of @racket[id-stx].}

        ]}

      @item{The result is @racket[(list _top-sym)] if @racket[id-stx]
            has a @tech{top-level binding} and
            @racket[top-level-symbol?] is true. The @racket[_top-sym]
            can be different from the name returned by
            @racket[syntax->datum] when the binding definition was
            generated by a macro invocation.}

      @item{The result is @racket[#f] if @racket[id-stx] has a
            @tech{top-level binding} and @racket[top-level-symbol?] is
            @racket[#f] or if @racket[id-stx] is @tech{unbound}. An
            unbound identifier is typically treated the same as an
            identifier whose top-level binding is a variable.}

      ]

If @racket[id-stx] is bound to a @tech{rename-transformer}, the result
from @racket[identifier-binding] is for the identifier in the
transformer, so that @racket[identifier-binding] is consistent with
@racket[free-identifier=?].

If @racket[exact-scopes?] is a true value, then the result is
@racket[#f] unless the binding for @racket[id-stx] has exactly the
@tech{scopes} of @racket[id-stx]. An exact-scopes check is useful for
detecting whether an identifier is already bound in a specific
definition context, for example.
