@title[#:tag "setup" #:style 'toc]{@exec{raco setup}: Installation Management}

The @exec{raco setup} command builds bytecode, documentation,
executables, and metadata indexes for all installed collections.

The collections that are built by @exec{raco setup} can be part of the
original Racket distribution, installed via the package manager (see
@other-manual[pkg-doc]), installed via
@|PLaneT| (see @other-manual['(lib "planet/planet.scrbl")]), linked
via @exec{raco link}, in a directory that is listed in the
@envvar{PLTCOLLECTS} environment variable, or placed into one of the
default collection directories.

The @exec{raco setup} tool itself does not directly support the
installation of collections, except through the now-discouraged
@Flag{A} flag (see @secref["raco-setup-A"]). The @exec{raco setup} command is
used by installation tools such as the package manager or @|PLaneT|.
Programmers who modify installed collections may find it useful to run
@exec{raco setup} as an alternative to un-installing and re-installing
a set of collections.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "running"]{Running @exec{raco setup}}

With no command-line arguments, @exec{raco setup} finds all of the
current collections---see @secref[#:doc ref-src]{collects}---and
compiles libraries in each collection.  (Directories that are named
@filepath{.git} or @filepath{.svn} are not treated as collections.)

To restrict @exec{raco setup} to a set of collections, provide the
collection names as arguments. For example, @exec{raco setup
scribblings/raco} would only compile and render the documentation for
@exec{raco}, which is implemented in a @filepath{scribblings/raco}
collection.

An optional @filepath{info.rkt} within the collection can indicate
specifically how the collection's files are to be compiled and other
actions to take in setting up a collection, such as creating
executables or building documentation. See @secref["setup-info"] for
more information.

The @exec{raco setup} command accepts the following command-line
flags:

@itemize[

@item{Constraining to specified collections or @|PLaneT| packages:
@itemize[

 @item{@DFlag{only} --- restrict setup to specified collections and
   @|PLaneT| packages, even if none are specified. This mode is the
   default if any collection is specified as a command-line argument
   or through the @Flag{l}, @DFlag{pkgs}, or @Flag{P} flag.}

 @item{@Flag{l} @nonterm{collection} @racket[...] --- constrain setup
  actions to the specified @nonterm{collection}s (i.e., the same as
  providing @nonterm{collections}s without a flag, but with no
  possibility that a @nonterm{collection} is interpreted as a flag).}

 @item{@DFlag{pkgs} @nonterm{pkg} @racket[...] --- constrain setup
  actions to collections that are within (or partially within) the
  named @nonterm{pkg}s.}

 @item{@Flag{P} @nonterm{owner} @nonterm{package-name} @nonterm{maj}
  @nonterm{min} --- constrain setup actions to the specified @|PLaneT|
  package, in addition to any other specified @|PLaneT| packages or
  collections.}

 @item{@DFlag{doc-index} --- build collections that implement
  documentation indexes (when documentation building is enabled), in
  addition to specified collections.}

 @item{@DFlag{tidy} --- remove metadata cache information and
  documentation for non-existent collections or documentation to
  clean up after removal, even when setup actions are otherwise
  confined to specified collections. Although tidying is not confined
  to specified collections, it can be constrained with @DFlag{avoid-main}
  or @DFlag{no-user}.}

@item{Constraining to specific tasks:
@itemize[

 @item{@DFlag{clean} or @Flag{c} --- delete existing @filepath{.zo}

   @elemref["clean"]{@racket[clean]} for more information. Unless
   @DFlag{no-info-domain} or @Flag{d} is also specified, the @filepath{info.rkt}
   cache is cleared. Unless @DFlag{no-docs} or @Flag{D} is also
   specified, the documentation-index database is reset.}

 @item{@DFlag{fast-clean} --- like @DFlag{clean}, but
   without forcing a bootstrap of @exec{raco setup} from source (which
   means that @DFlag{fast-clean} cannot clean corruption that affects
   @exec{raco setup} itself).}

 @item{@DFlag{no-zo} or @Flag{n} --- refrain from compiling source
   files to @filepath{.zo} files.}

 @item{@DFlag{trust-zos} --- fix timestamps on @filepath{.zo} files on
   the assumption that they are already up-to-date (unless the
   @envvar{PLT_COMPILED_FILE_CHECK} environment variable is set to
   @litchar{exists}, in which case timestamps are ignored).}

 @item{@DFlag{recompile-only} --- disallow recompilation of modules
  from source, imposing the constraint that each @filepath{.zo} file

  recompiled from an existing @filepath{.zo} in machine-independent
  format (when compiling to a machine-dependent format).}

 @item{@DFlag{recompile-cache} @nonterm{dir} --- cache module
  recompilations (from machine-independent format to machine-dependent
  format) in @nonterm{dir}.}

 @item{@DFlag{sync-docs-only} --- synchronize or move documentation
   into place to ``build'' it, but do not run or render documentation
   sources.}

   executables or installing @tt{man} pages (as specified in
   @filepath{info.rkt}; see @secref["setup-info"]).}

   libraries (as specified in @filepath{info.rkt}; see
   @secref["setup-info"]).}

 @item{@DFlag{only-foreign-libs} --- disable actions other than
   installing foreign libraries; equivalent to @Flag{nxiIdD}, except
   that @DFlag{only-foreign-libs} doesn't reject (redundant)
   specification of those individual flags.}

   post-install actions (as specified in @filepath{info.rkt} files; see
   @secref["setup-info"]).}

 @item{@DFlag{no-info-domain} or @Flag{d} --- refrain from building
   a cache of metadata information from @filepath{info.rkt}
   files. This cache is needed by other tools. For example,

 @item{@DFlag{no-docs} or @Flag{D} --- refrain from building

 @item{@DFlag{unused-pkg-deps} --- attempt to report dependencies that
  are declared but are unused. Beware that some package dependencies
  may be intentionally unused (e.g., declared to force installation of
  other packages as a convenience), and beware that package
  dependencies may be reported as unused only because compilation of
  relevant modules has been suppressed.  See
  @secref["setup-check-deps"] for more information.}

   by @nonterm{mode}. The compiler is obtained by using @nonterm{mode}
   as a collection name, finding a @filepath{zo-compile.rkt} module in
   that collection, and extracting its @racket[zo-compile] export. The
   @racket[zo-compile] export should be a function like
   @racket[compile]; see the @filepath{errortrace} collection for an

 @item{@DFlag{error-out} @nonterm{file} --- handle survivable errors

  facilitates chaining multiple @exec{raco setup} invocations in
  combination with @DFlag{error-in}. If there are no errors and
  @nonterm{file} already exists, it is deleted.}

 @item{@DFlag{error-in} @nonterm{file} --- treat the existence of
  @nonterm{file} as a ``errors were reported by a previous process''
  error. Typically, @nonterm{file} is created by previous @exec{raco
  setup} run using @DFlag{error-out}. A file for @DFlag{error-in} is
  detected before creating a file via @DFlag{error-out}, so the same
  file can be used to chain a sequence of @exec{raco setup} steps.}

 @item{@DFlag{pause} or @Flag{p} --- pause for user input if any
  errors are reported (so that a user has time to inspect output that
  might otherwise disappear when the @exec{raco setup} process ends).}

@itemize[

 @item{@Flag{A} @nonterm{archive} @racket[...] --- Install each

 @item{@DFlag{boot} @nonterm{module-file} @nonterm{build-dir} --- For

       through @exec{raco setup}, loads @nonterm{module-file} in the
       same way that @exec{raco setup} normally loads itself,
       auto-detecting the need to start from sources and rebuild the
       compiled files---even for the compilation manager itself. The
       @nonterm{build-dir} path is installed as the only path in
       @racket[current-compiled-file-roots], so all compiled files
       go there.}

       Like @DFlag{boot}, but adds @nonterm{build-dir} to the start of
       @racket[current-compiled-file-roots] instead of replacing the
       current value, which means that libraries already built in the
       normal location (including the compilation manager itself) will
       be used instead of rebuilt. This mode makes sense for
       cross-compilation.}

]}

]

When building @exec{racket}, flags can be provided to @exec{raco
setup} as run by @exec{make install} by setting the
@as-index{@envvar{PLT_SETUP_OPTIONS}} makefile variable. For
example, the following command line uses a single process to build
collections during an install:

   @commandline{make install PLT_SETUP_OPTIONS="-j 1"}

Running @exec{raco setup} is sensitive to the
@envvar{PLT_COMPILED_FILE_CHECK} environment variable in the same way
as @exec{raco make}. Specifically, if @envvar{PLT_COMPILED_FILE_CHECK}
is set to @litchar{exists}, then @exec{raco make} does not attempt to
update a compiled file's timestamp if the file is not recompiled.

Some additional environment variables are useful for performance
debugging:

@itemlist[

 @item{@indexed-envvar{PLT_SETUP_DMS_ARGS} triggers a call to
       @racket[dump-memory-stats] after each collection is compiled,
       where the environment variable's value is parsed with
       @racket[read] to obtain a list of arguments to
       @racket[dump-memory-stats].}

 @item{@indexed-envvar{PLT_SETUP_LIMIT_CACHE} (set to anything) avoids
       caching compiled-file information across different collections,
       which is useful to reduce noise when looking for memory leaks.}

 @item{@indexed-envvar{PLT_SETUP_NO_FORCE_GC} (set to anything)
       suppresses a call to @racket[collect-garbage] that is issued by
       default for non-parallel builds after each collection is
       compiled and after each document is run or rendered.}

 @item{@indexed-envvar{PLT_SETUP_SHOW_TIMESTAMPS} (set to anything)
       appends the current process time after @litchar[" @ "] for each
       status message printed by @exec{raco setup}.}

@section[#:tag "raco-setup-A"]{Installing @filepath{.plt} Archives}

A @filepath{.plt} file is a platform-independent distribution archive
for software based on Racket. A typical @filepath{.plt} file can be
installed as a package using @exec{raco pkg} (see @other-manual['(lib
"pkg/scribblings/pkg.scrbl")]), in which case @exec{raco pkg} supplies
facilities for uninstalling the package and managing dependencies.

An older approach is to supply a @filepath{.plt} file to @exec{raco
setup} with the @Flag{A} flag; the files contained in the
@filepath{.plt} archive are unpacked (according to specifications
embedded in the @filepath{.plt} file) and only collections specified
by the @filepath{.plt} file are compiled and setup. Archives processed
in this way can include arbitrary code that is executed at install
time, in addition to any actions triggered by the normal
collection-setup part of @exec{raco setup}.

Finally, the @exec{raco unpack} (see @secref["unpack"]) command can
list the content of a @filepath{.plt} archive or unpack the archive
without installing it as a package or collection.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "setup-info"]{Controlling @exec{raco setup} with @filepath{info.rkt} Files}

To compile a collection's files to bytecode, @exec{raco setup} uses the
@racket[compile-collection-zos] procedure. That procedure, in turn,
consults the collection's @filepath{info.rkt} file, if it exists, for
specific instructions on compiling the collection. See
@racket[compile-collection-zos] for more information on the fields of
@filepath{info.rkt} that it uses, and see @secref["info.rkt"] for
information on the format of an @filepath{info.rkt} file.

Additional fields are used by the
@seclink["top" #:doc '(lib "pkg/scribblings/pkg.scrbl") "Racket package manager"]
and are documented in @secref["metadata" #:doc '(lib "pkg/scribblings/pkg.scrbl")].
The @exec{raco test} command also recognizes additional fields, which are
documented in @secref["test-config-info" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/raco/raco.scrbl")].

Optional @filepath{info.rkt} fields trigger additional actions by
@exec{raco setup}:

@itemize[

 @item{@as-index{@racketidfont{scribblings}} : @racket[(listof (cons/c string? list?))] ---
   A list of documents to build. Each document in the list is itself
   represented as a list, where each document's list starts with a
   string that is a collection-relative path to the document's source
   file. A document name (which is derived from the source module's
   name by default) is intended to be globally unique in the same way
   as a package or module name.

   More precisely a @racketidfont{scribblings} entry must be a value
   that can be generated from an expression matching the following
   @racket[_entry] grammar:

   @racketgrammar*[
     #:literals (list)
     [entry (list doc ...)]
     [doc (list src-string)
          (list src-string flags)
          (list src-string flags category)
          (list src-string flags category name)
          (list src-string flags category name out-k)
          (list src-string flags category name out-k order-n)]
     [flags (list mode-symbol ...)]
     [category (list category-string-or-symbol)
               (list category-string-or-symbol sort-number)
               (list category-string-or-symbol sort-number lang-fam)]
     [lang-fam (list string ...)]
     [name string
           #f]
   ]

   A document's list optionally continues with information on how to
   build the document. If a document's list contains a second item,
   @racket[_flags], it must be a list of mode symbols (described
   below). If a document's list contains a third item,
   @racket[_category], it must be a list that categorizes the document
   (described further below). If a document's list contains a fourth
   item, @racket[_name], it is a name to use for the generated
   documentation, instead of defaulting to the source file's name
   (sans extension), where @racket[#f] means to use the default; a
   non-@racket[#f] value for @racket[_name] must fit the grammar
   of a collection-name element as checked by 
   @racket[collection-name-element?]. If a
   document's list contains a fifth item, @racket[_out-k], it is used
   a hint for the number of files to use for the document's
   cross-reference information; see below. If a document's list
   contains a fourth item, @racket[_order-n], it is used a hint for
   the order of rendering; see below.

   Each mode symbol in @racket[_flags] can be one of the following,
   where only @racket['multi-page] is commonly used:

   @itemize[

     @item{@racket['multi-page] : Generates multi-page HTML output,
           instead of the default single-page format.}

     @item{@racket['main-doc] : Indicates that the generated
           documentation should be written into the main installation
           directory, instead of to a user-specific directory. This
           mode is the default for a collection that is itself located
           in the main installation.}

     @item{@racket['user-doc] : Indicates that the generated
           documentation should be written a user-specific
           directory. This mode is the default for a collection that
           is not itself located in the main installation.}

     @item{@racket['depends-all] : Indicates that the document should
           be rebuilt if any other document is rebuilt---except for
           documents that have the @racket['no-depend-on] flag.}

     @item{@racket['depends-all-main] : Indicates that the document
           should be rebuilt if any other document is rebuilt that is
           installed into the main installation---except for documents
           that have the @racket['no-depend-on] flag.}

     @item{@racket['depends-all-user] : Indicates that the document
           should be rebuilt if any other document is rebuilt that is
           installed into the user's space---except for documents
           that have the @racket['no-depend-on] flag.}

     @item{@racket['always-run] : Build the document every time that
           @exec{raco setup} is run, even if none of its dependencies
           change.}

     @item{@racket['no-depend-on] : Removes the document for
           consideration for other dependencies. Furthermore,
           references from the document to other documents are always
           direct, instead of potentially indirect (i.e., resolved at

    The @racket[_category] list specifies how to show the document in
    the root table of contents and, for the @racket[_lang-fam] part,
    how to classify the documentation's content for searching.
    The list must start with a category,
    which determines where the manual appears in the root
    documentation page. A category is either a string or a symbol. If
    it is a string, then the string is the category label on the root
    page. If it is a symbol, then a default category label is
    used. The available symbols and the order of categories on the
    root documentation page is as below:

   @itemize[

           documentation, typeset at the same level as other
           category titles.}

           searching.}

   ]

   If the @racket[_category] list is not given, or if the category symbol is unrecognized,
   the documentation is added to the Miscellaneous Libraries (@racket['library]) category.

   If the category list has a second element, @racket[_sort-number], it must be a real number
   that designates the manual's sorting position with the category;
   manuals with the same sorting position are ordered
   alphabetically. For a pair of manuals with sorting numbers
   @racket[_n] and @racket[_m], the groups for the manuals are
   separated by space if @racket[(truncate (/ _n 10))]and
   @racket[(truncate (/ _m 10))] are different.

   If the category list has a third element, @racket[_lang-fam], then
   it must be a list of strings, where each string names a language
   family. This language family list is used for index entries that
   are extracted from the document and used for searching. The
   document, a part within the document, or an individual index
   entries may specify its own language family, and @racket[_lang-fam]
   provides only a default for entries that do not otherwise specify a
   language family. Alternatively, a document may specify a default
   that can be overridden by @racket[_lang-fam] through a
   @racket['default-language-family] key in @racket[tag-prefix] of the
   document's @racket[part]; that specification, in turn, might be
   supplied in the document's source via the @racket[#:tag-prefix]
   argument to @racket[title].

   The @racket[_out-k] specification is a hint on whether to break the
   document's cross-reference information into multiple parts, which
   can reduce the time and memory use for resolving a cross-reference
   into the document. It must be a positive, exact integer, and the
   default is @racket[1].

   The @racket[_order-n] specification is a hint for ordering document
   builds, since documentation references can be mutually recursive.
   The order hint can be any real number. A value of @racket[-10] or
   less disables running the document in parallel to other documents.
   The main Racket reference is given a value of @racket[-11], the
   search page is given a value of @racket[10], and the default is
   @racket[0].

   A directory for pre-rendered documentation is computed from the
   source file name by starting with the directory of the
   @filepath{info.rkt} file, adding @filepath{doc}, and then using the
   document name (which is usually the source file's name without a
   suffix); if such a directory exists and does not have a
   @filepath{synced.rktd} file, then it is treated as pre-rendered
   documentation and moved into place, in which case the documentation
   source file need not be present. Moving documentation into place
   may require no movement at all, depending on the way that the
   enclosing collection is installed, but movement includes adding a
   @filepath{synced.rktd} file to represent the installation.

 @item{@as-index{@racketidfont{release-note-files}} : @racket[(listof (cons/c string? (cons/c string? list?)))] ---
   A list of release-notes text files to link from the main documentation pages.
   Each note is itself represented as a list, and the list can specify auxiliary
   notes that are grouped with the main note.

   A @racketidfont{release-note-files} entry must be a value
   that can be generated from an expression matching the following
   @racket[_entry] grammar:

   @racketgrammar*[
     #:literals (list)
     [entry (list note ...)]
     [doc (list label-string note-path)

                (list sub-note ...))]
     [sub-note (list label-string note-path)]
   ]

   The @racket[_order-integer] is used to order notes and defaults to @racket[0].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[racket-launcher-names] : @racket[(listof string?)]
   --- @elemtag["racket-launcher-names"] A list of executable names
   to be generated in the installation's executable directory to run
   Racket-based programs implemented by the collection. A parallel
   list of library names must be provided by
   @racket[racket-launcher-libraries] or
   @racket[racket-launcher-flags].

   For each name, a launching executable is set up using
   @racket[make-racket-launcher].  The arguments are @Flag{l-} and
   @tt{@nonterm{colls}/.../@nonterm{file}}, where @nonterm{file} is
   the file named by @racket[racket-launcher-libraries] and
   @tt{@nonterm{colls}/...}  are the collections (and subcollections)
   of the @filepath{info.rkt} file.

   In addition,

   @racketblock[
    (build-aux-from-path
     (build-path (collection-path #,(nonterm "colls") _...) #,(nonterm "suffixless-file")))
   ]

   is provided for the optional @racket[_aux] argument (for icons,
   etc.) to @racket[make-racket-launcher], where
   @nonterm{suffixless-file} is @nonterm{file} without its suffix.

   If @racket[racket-launcher-flags] is provided, it is used as a
   list of command-line arguments passed to @exec{racket} instead of
   the above default, allowing arbitrary command-line arguments. If
   @racket[racket-launcher-flags] is specified together with
   @racket[racket-launcher-libraries], then the flags will override
   the libraries, but the libraries can still be used to specify a
   name for @racket[build-aux-from-path] (to find related information
   like icon files etc).}

 @item{@indexed-racket[copy-foreign-libs] : @racket[(listof (and/c
   path-string? relative-path?))] --- Files to copy into a
   directory where foreign libraries are found by @racket[ffi-lib].
   If @racket[install-platform] is defined, then the files are copied
   only if the current platform matches the definition.

   On Mac OS, when a Mach-O file is copied, if the copied file
   includes a library reference that starts @litchar{@"@"loader_path/},
   and if the referenced library exists in a different location among
   the paths listed by @racket[(get-lib-search-dirs)], then the
   library reference is updated to an absolute path.

   On Unix, when an ELF file is copied, if the copied file includes an
   RPATH setting of @litchar{$ORIGIN} and the file is being installed
   to a user-specific location, then the file's RPATH is adjusted to
   @litchar{$ORIGIN:} followed by the path to the main installation's
   library directory as reported by @racket[(find-lib-dir)].

   On Windows, deleting a previously installed foreign library may be
   complicated by a lock on the file, if it is in use. To compensate,
   @exec{raco setup} deletes a foreign-library file by first renaming
   the file to have the prefix @filepath{raco-setup-delete-}; it then
   attempts to delete the renamed file and merely issues a warning on
   a failure to delete the renamed file. Meanwhile, in modes where
   @exec{raco setup} removes uninstalled libraries, it attempts to
   delete any file in the foreign-library directory whose name starts
   with @filepath{raco-setup-delete-} (in an attempt to clean up after
   previous failures).}

 @item{@indexed-racket[move-foreign-libs] : @racket[(listof (and/c
   path-string? relative-path?))] --- Like @racket[copy-foreign-libs],

   path-string? relative-path?))] --- Files to copy into a
   directory where shared files are found.
   If @racket[install-platform] is defined, then the files are copied
   only if the current platform matches the definition.

   On Windows, uninstalled files are deleted in the same way as for
   @racket[copy-foreign-libs], and the name prefix
   @filepath{raco-setup-delete-} is similarly special.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[move-shared-files] : @racket[(listof (and/c

 @item{@indexed-racket[copy-man-pages] : @racket[(listof (and/c
   path-string? relative-path? filename-extension))] --- Files to copy
   into a @tt{man} directory. The file suffix determines its category;
   for example, @litchar{.1} should be used for a @tt{man} page
   describing an executable.

   On Windows, uninstalled files are deleted in the same way as for
   @racket[copy-foreign-libs], and the name prefix
   @filepath{raco-setup-delete-} is similarly special.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[move-man-pages] : @racket[(listof (and/c

   @racket[move-shared-files]. Also see @racket[matching-platform?] for
   information on the way that the specification is compared to

 @item{@indexed-racket[install-collection] : @racket[path-string?] ---
   A library module relative to the collection that provides
   @racket[installer]. The @racket[installer] procedure must accept
   one, two, three, or four arguments:

   @itemlist[

   @item{The first argument is a directory path to the parent of the
   Racket installation's @filepath{collects} directory.}

   @item{The second argument, if accepted, is a path to the
   collection's own directory.}

   @item{The third argument, if accepted, is a boolean indicating
   whether the collection is installed as user-specific (@racket[#t])
   or installation-wide (@racket[#f]).}

   @item{The fourth argument, if accepted, is a boolean indicating
   whether the collection is installed as installation-wide and should
   nevertheless avoid modifying the installation; an
   @racket[installer] procedure that does not accept this argument is
   never called when the argument would be @racket[#t]. An installer
   that does accept this argument is called with @racket[#t] to that
   it can perform user-specific work, even though the collection is
   installed installation-wide.}

   ]}

 @item{@indexed-racket[pre-install-collection] : @racket[path-string?] ---
   Like @racket[install-collection], except that the corresponding
   installer procedures are called @emph{before} the normal @filepath{.zo} build,
   instead of after. The provided procedure is
   @racket[pre-installer], so it can be provided by the
   same file that provides an @racket[installer] procedure.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[post-install-collection] : @racket[path-string?]  ---
   Like @racket[install-collection] for a procedure that is called right after the
   @racket[install-collection] procedure is executed. The
   @DFlag{no-install} flag can be provided to @exec{raco setup}
   to disable @racket[install-collection] and @racket[pre-install-collection],
   but not @racket[post-install-collection].  The @racket[post-install-collection]
   function is therefore expected to perform operations that are always needed,
   even after an installation that contains pre-compiled files. The
   provided procedure is @racket[post-installer], so it
   can be provided by the same file that provides an
   @racket[installer] procedure.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[assume-virtual-sources] : @racket[any/c] ---
   A true value indicates that bytecode files without a corresponding
   source file should not be removed from @filepath{compiled} directories,
   and no files should not be removed when the
   @DFlag{clean} or @Flag{c} flag is passed to @exec{raco setup}.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[clean] : @racket[(listof path-string?)] ---
   @elemtag["clean"] A list of pathnames to be deleted when the
   @DFlag{clean} or @Flag{c} flag is passed to @exec{raco setup}. The
   pathnames must be relative to the collection. If any path names a
   directory, each of the files in the directory are deleted, but none
   of the subdirectories of the directory are checked. If the path
   names a file, the file is deleted. The default, if this flag is not
   specified, is to delete all files in the @filepath{compiled}
   subdirectory, and all of the files in the platform-specific
   subdirectory of the compiled directory for the current platform.

   Just as compiling @filepath{.zo} files will compile each module
   used by a compiled module, deleting a module's compiled image will
   delete the @filepath{.zo} of each module that is used by the
   module. More specifically, used modules are determined when
   deleting a @filepath{.dep} file, which would have been created to
   accompany a @filepath{.zo} file when the @filepath{.zo} was built
   by @exec{raco setup} or @exec{raco make} (see
   @secref["Dependency\x20Files"]). If the @filepath{.dep} file
   indicates another module, that module's @filepath{.zo} is deleted
   only if it also has an accompanying @filepath{.dep} file. In that
   case, the @filepath{.dep} file is deleted, and additional used
   modules are deleted based on the used module's @filepath{.dep}
   file, etc. Supplying a specific list of collections to @exec{raco
   setup} disables this dependency-based deletion of compiled files.}

   @racket[compile-include-files] --- Used indirectly via
   @racket[compile-collection-zos].}

@section[#:tag "setup-check-deps"]{Package Dependency Checking}

When @exec{raco setup} is run with no arguments,@margin-note*{Unless
@DFlag{check-pkg-deps} is specified, dependency checking is disabled
if any collection is specified for @exec{raco setup}.} after building
all collections and documentation, @exec{raco setup} checks package
dependencies. Specifically, it inspects compiled files and
documentation to check that references across package boundaries are
reflected by dependency declarations in each package-level
@filepath{info.rkt} file (see @secref[#:doc pkg-doc "metadata"]).

Dependency checking in @exec{raco setup} is intended as an aid to
package developers to help them declare dependencies correctly. The
@exec{raco setup} process itself does not depend on package dependency
declarations. Similarly, a package with a missing dependency
declaration may install successfully for other users, as long as they
happen to have the dependencies installed already. A missing
dependency creates trouble for others who install a package without
having the dependency installed already.

Practically every package depends on the @filepath{base} package,
which includes the collections that are in a minimal variant of
Racket. Declaring a dependency on @filepath{base} may seem
unnecessary, since its collections are always installed. In a future
version of Racket, however, the minimal collections may change, and
the new set of minimal collections will then have a package name, such
as @filepath{base2}. Declaring a dependency on @filepath{base} ensures
forward compatibility, and @exec{raco setup} complains if the
declaration is missing.

To accommodate the early stages of package development, missing
dependencies are not treated as an error for a package that has no
dependency declarations.

@subsection{Declaring Build-Time Dependencies}

A build-time dependency is one that is not present in a package if it
is converted to a @tech[#:doc pkg-doc]{binary package} (see
@secref[#:doc pkg-doc "strip"]). For example, @filepath{tests} and
@filepath{scribblings} directories are stripped away in a binary
package by default, so cross-package references from directories with
those names are treated as build dependencies. Similarly,
@racketidfont{test} and @racketidfont{doc} submodules are stripped
away, so references within those submodules create build dependencies.

Build-time-only dependencies can be listed as @racket[build-deps]
instead of @racket[deps] in a package's @filepath{info.rkt} file.
Dependencies listed in @racket[deps], meanwhile, are treated as both
run-time and build-time dependencies. The advantage of using
@racket[build-deps], instead of listing all dependencies in
@racket[deps], is that a binary version of the package can install
with fewer dependencies.

@subsection{How Dependency Checking Works}

Dependency checking uses @filepath{.zo} files, associated
@filepath{.dep} files (see @secref["Dependency Files"]), and the
documentation index. Dynamic references, such as through
@racket[dynamic-require], are not visible to the dependency checker;
only dependencies via @racket[require],
@racket[define-runtime-module-path-index], and other forms that
cooperate with @racket[raco make] are visible for dependency checking.

Dependency checking is sensitive to whether a dependency is needed
only as a build-time dependency. If @exec{raco setup} detects that a
missing dependency could be added as a build-time dependency, it will
suggest the addition, but @exec{raco setup} will not suggest
converting a normal dependency to a build-time dependency (since every
normal dependency counts as a build-time dependency, too).

@subsection{@exec{raco setup} Unit}

@defmodule[setup/setup-unit]

The @racketmodname[setup/setup-unit] library provides @exec{raco setup} in unit
form. The associated @racket[setup/option-sig] and
@racket[setup/option-unit] libraries provides the interface for
setting options for the run of @exec{raco setup}.

For example, to unpack a single @filepath{.plt} archive
@filepath{x.plt}, set the @sigelem[setup-option^ archives] parameter
to @racket[(list "x.plt")] and leave @sigelem[setup-option^
specific-collections] as @racket[null].

Link the options and setup units so that your option-setting code is
initialized between them, e.g.:

@racketblock[
(compound-unit
  _...
  (link _...
    [((OPTIONS : setup-option^)) setup:option@]
    [() my-init-options@ OPTIONS]
    [() setup@ OPTIONS _...])

 it no directory with the installation's configured name exists, then
 @racket["other-version"] is used as the installation name. So, by

 sharing of packages and collections across installations/versions,
 while opting out for a specific installation/version by creating
 a directory with that installation's name.

@defmodule[setup/getinfo]{ The @racketmodname[setup/getinfo] library

   Accepts a path to a directory. If it finds either a well-formed
   @filepath{info.rkt} file or an @filepath{info.ss} file (with
   preference for the @filepath{info.rkt} file), 
   it returns an info procedure that accepts either one
   or two arguments. The first argument to the info procedure is
   always a symbolic name, and the result is the value of the name in
   the @filepath{info.rkt} file, if the name is defined. The optional
   second argument, @racket[_thunk], is a procedure that takes no
   arguments to be called when the name is not defined; the result of
   the info procedure is the result of the @racket[_thunk] in that
   case. If the name is not defined and no @racket[_thunk] is
   provided, then an exception is raised.

   The @racket[get-info/full] function returns @racket[#f] if there is
   no @filepath{info.rkt} (or @filepath{info.ss}) file in the directory. If there is a
   @filepath{info.rkt} (or @filepath{info.ss}) file that has the wrong shape (i.e., not a module
   using @racketmodname[info] or @racketmodname[setup/infotab]),
   or if the @filepath{info.rkt} file fails to load, then an exception
   is raised. If the @filepath{info.rkt} file loaded, @racket[get-info/full]
   returns the @racket[get-info] file. If the @filepath{info.rkt} file does not exist, 
   then @racket[get-info/full] does
   the same checks for the @filepath{info.ss} file, either raising an exception
   or returning the @racket[get-info] function from the @filepath{info.ss} file.

   The @filepath{info.rkt} (or @filepath{info.ss}) module is loaded
   into @racket[namespace] if it is not @racket[#f], or a private,
   weakly-held namespace otherwise.

   If @racket[bootstrap?] is true, then
   @racket[use-compiled-file-paths] is set to @racket['()] while
   reading @filepath{info.rkt} (or @filepath{info.ss}), in case an
   existing compiled file is broken. Furthermore, the
   @racketmodname[info] and @racketmodname[setup/infotab] modules are
   attached to @racket[namespace] from the namespace of
   @racket[get-info/full] before attempting to load
   @filepath{info.rkt} (or @filepath{info.ss}).

   As the module is loaded, the @tech[#:doc reference-doc]{environment variable set}
   is pruned to contain only environment variables that are listed in the
   @envvar{PLT_INFO_ALLOW_VARS} environment variable, which contains a
   @litchar{;}-separated list of names. By default, the list of allowed
   variable names is empty.

   Returns a list of paths identifying
   collections and installed @|PLaneT| packages whose
   @filepath{info.rkt} file defines one or more of the given

   @exec{raco setup}.

   Note that the cache may be out of date by the time you call
   @racket[get-info/full], so do not assume that every returned
   directory's @filepath{info.rkt} file will supply one of the
   requested symbols.

   The result is in a canonical order (sorted lexicographically by
   directory name), and the paths it returns are suitable for
   providing to @racket[get-info/full].

   If @racket[mode] is specified, it must be either
   @racket['preferred] (the default), @racket['all-available],
   @racket['no-planet], or @racket['no-user]. If @racket[mode] is
   @racket['all-available], @racket[find-relevant-directories] returns
   all installed directories whose info files contain the specified
   symbols---for instance, all versions of all installed @|PLaneT|
   packages will be searched if @racket['all-available] is
   specified. If @racket[mode] is @racket['preferred], then only a
   subset of ``preferred'' packages will be searched: only the
   directory containing the most recent version of any @|PLaneT| package
   will be returned. If @racket[mode] is @racket['no-planet], then
   @|PLaneT| packages are not included in the search. If @racket[mode] is
   @racket['no-user], then only installation-wide directories are
   searched, which means omitting @|PLaneT| package directories.

   Regardless of @racket[mode], note that @racket[find-relevant-directories]
   will not consider package-level @filepath{info.rkt} files for

@section[#:tag "relative-paths"]{API for Relative Paths}

The Racket installation tree can usually be moved around the filesystem.
To support this, care must be taken to avoid absolute paths.  The
following two APIs cover two aspects of this: a way to convert a path to
a value that is relative to the @filepath{collects} tree, and a way to
display such paths (e.g., in error messages).

@subsection{Representing Collection-Based Paths}

@defmodule[setup/collects]

@racket[path->complete-path] and @racket[simplify-path] with
@racket[#f] as its second argument) matches the result of
@racket[collection-file-path]. If so, the result is a list starting
with @racket['collects] and containing the relevant path elements as
byte strings. If not, the path is returned as-is.

The @racket[cache] argument is used with @racket[path->pkg], if needed.}

@defproc[(collects-relative->path

         path-string?]{

The inverse of @racket[path->collects-relative]: if @racket[rel]
is a pair that starts with @racket['collects], then it is converted
back to a path using @racket[collection-file-path].}

@defproc[(path->main-collects-relative [path (or/c bytes? path-string?)])

with @racket['collects] and containing the remaining path elements as
byte strings. If not, the path is returned as-is.

The @racket[path] argument should be a complete path. Applying
@racket[simplify-path] before @racket[path->main-collects-relative] is
usually a good idea.

For historical reasons, @racket[path] can be a byte string, which is
converted to a path using @racket[bytes->path].

See also @racket[collects-relative->path].}

  result is a string that begins with @racket["<pkgs>/"]. If the path
  is an absolute one that is inside the @filepath{collects} tree, the
  result is a string that begins with @racket["<collects>/"].
  Similarly, a path in the user-specific collects results in a prefix of
  @racket["<user-collects>/"], a @PLaneT path results in
  @racket["<planet>/"], and a path into documentation results in
  @racket["<doc>/"] or @racket["<user-doc>/"].

  If @racket[cache] is not @racket[#f], it is used as a cache argument
  for @racket[path->pkg] to speed up detection and conversion of
  package paths.

  If the path is not absolute, or if it is not in any of these, it is
  returned as-is (converted to a string if needed).  If @racket[default]
  is given, it specifies the return value instead: it can be a procedure
  that is applied onto the path to get the result, or the result
  itself.

  Note that this function can return a non-string only if
  @racket[default] is given and it does not return a string.

@section[#:tag "cross-system"]{API for Cross-Platform Configuration}

See @other-doc[#:indirect @exec{raco cross} '(lib
"raco/private/cross/raco-cross.scrbl")] for information about
@exec{raco cross}, a tool that is provided by the
@filepath{raco-cross} package as a convenient interface to
cross-compilation for Racket. The underlying API documented here
supports @exec{raco cross} and other tools.

@defmodule[setup/cross-system]{The @racketmodname[setup/cross-system]
library provides functions for querying the system properties of a
destination platform, which can be different than the current platform
in cross-installation modes.}

A Racket installation includes a @filepath{system.rktd} file in the
directory reported by @racket[(find-lib-dir)]. When the information in that file
does not match the running Racket's information, then the
@racketmodname[setup/cross-system] module infers that Racket is being
run in cross-installation mode.

For example, if an in-place Racket @BC
installation for a different platform resides at @nonterm{cross-dir},
then running Racket BC as

@commandline{racket -C -G @nonterm{cross-dir}/etc -X @nonterm{cross-dir}/collects -l- raco pkg}

runs @exec{raco pkg} using the current platform's @exec{racket}
executable, but using the collections and other configuration
information of @nonterm{cross-dir}, as well as modifying the packages
of @nonterm{cross-dir}. That can work as long as no platform-specific
libraries need to run to perform the requested @exec{raco pkg} action
(e.g., when installing built packages), or as long as the current
platform's installation already includes those libraries.

For Racket @CS, cross compilation is more
complicated, because Racket CS @filepath{.zo} files are
platform-specific:

@itemlist[

 @item{A target installation @nonterm{cross-dir} is needed that
       includes cross-compilation support for the host platform as
       plug-in within the installation's
       @filepath{@nonterm{cross-dir}/lib} directory. That installation
       might be created by compiling from source on the host platform.
       Only Racket CS can use a CS cross-compilation plug-in.

       When running @exec{racket} in cross mode, use the
       @DFlag{cross-compiler} flag to specify the target machine and
       path to the @filepath{@nonterm{cross-dir}/lib} directory.}

 @item{A flag combination @Flag{MCR} with argument
       @filepath{@nonterm{absolute-zo-dir}:} is needed to enable
       @filepath{.zo} file creation for both the host platform (which
       uses the directory before a @litchar{:}) and the target
       platform (which uses the normal compiled-file subdirectory when
       the path after the @litchar{:} is empty).

       The @nonterm{absolute-zo-dir} can be any absolute path. It
       generally should be populated by running @exec{raco setup} in
       cross mode before commands like @exec{raco pkg}.}

]

For example, the @exec{raco pkg} example for Racket CS is

@verbatim[#:indent 2]{
  racket --cross-compiler @nonterm{target-machine} @nonterm{cross-dir}/lib \
    -MCR @nonterm{absolute-zo-dir}: \
    -G @nonterm{cross-dir}/etc -X @nonterm{cross-dir}/collects -l- raco pkg
}

The @nonterm{target-machine} provided to @DFlag{cross-compiler} should
be the same as the @racketidfont{target-machine} entry in
@filepath{@nonterm{cross-dir}/lib/systemd.rktd}.

The @Flag{C} flag is shorthand for @DFlag{cross}, @Flag{M} is short
for @DFlag{compile-any}, @Flag{R} is short for @DFlag{compiled},
@Flag{G} is short for @DFlag{config}, @Flag{X} is short for
@DFlag{collects}, and @Flag{MCR} is short for @exec{@Flag{M} @Flag{C}
@Flag{R}}.

@section[#:tag "layered-install"]{Layered Installations}

A typical Racket configuration includes two layers: an
@defterm{installation} layer and a @defterm{user} layer. The intent is
that the @defterm{installation} layer is read-only to all users of a
system, while the @defterm{user} layer allows each individual user to
install additional packages that extend the @defterm{installation}
layer. The @defterm{installation} layer is intended not only to be
read-only, but to not change after users start installing in their own
layers.

In an environment where Racket itself is under development, the
@defterm{installation} layer will change. In that setting, if the
@defterm{user} layer is used at all, care must be taken to not create
conflicts for the user layer when modifying the installation
layer---or else the user layer must be repaired on occasion.

By default, @exec{raco setup} updates both layers whenever it is run;
if a user does not have write permission the installation, @exec{raco
setup} with no arguments is all but certain to report permission
errors. The actions of @exec{raco setup} can be constrained to the
@defterm{user} layer by supplying the @DFlag{avoid-main} argument, or
@exec{raco setup} can be constrained to the @defterm{installation}
layer by using the @DFlag{no-user} argument. When @exec{raco pkg}
performs setup actions, it effectively supplies one of the other of
those based on the package's scope (and @exec{raco pkg} refuses to
operate on both scopes/layers at once).

The @defterm{user} layer is always both user- and version-specific.
More precisely, it is specific to the user and an installation's name,
where the installation's name is typically its version number.
However, the name of an installation can be changed through the
@racket['installation] setting in @filepath{config.rktd} (see
@secref["config-file"]). Setting an installation name changes the
directory where packages and executables reside within
@racket[(find-system-path 'addon-dir)]. The result of
@racket[(find-system-path 'addon-dir)] itself can be changed through
@racket['addon-dir] in @filepath{config.rktd}.

The @defterm{installation} and @defterm{user} configuration layers can
be generalized to multiple layers by setting search paths in
@filepath{config.rktd}. These search paths essentially treat the layer
closest to @defterm{user} as the @defterm{installation} layer that
might be adjusted by @exec{raco setup} and @exec{raco pkg}, but search
paths can chain to an existing (unchanging) implementation in much the
same way that @defterm{user} chains to @defterm{installation}. To
build a new layer, create new @filepath{config.rktd} that is like the
underlying layer's @filepath{config.rktd}, but
@;
@itemlist[

 @item{each of @racket['lib-dir], @racket['share-dir],
       @racket['links-file], @racket['pkgs-dir], @racket['bin-dir],

       needed), @racket['doc-search-dirs], and
       @racket['man-search-dirs] each add the old directory or file to
       the search list just after @racket[#f]; note that the default
       for each search list is @racket[(list #f)].}

]
@;
There is no argument to @exec{raco setup} that is analogous to
@DFlag{avoid-main} to avoid modifying nested layer; instead, nested
layers are expected to be fully set up so that @exec{raco setup}
need not change them. When @exec{raco setup} would otherwise install
an executable into the directory configured as @racket['bin-dir], it
consults the @racket['bin-search-dirs] list to check whether the
executable is already installed in one of those directories, and if so,
it will refrain from creating a copy in the new layer. The same
search-list check also applies to native libraries, shared files, and
man pages, but with the additional check that the file to install matches
the one that is already installed.

The default path to @filepath{config.rktd} is hardwired within a
@exec{racket} executable. In some cases, it can make sense for the
innermost layer's configuration to point to another layer, perhaps
because the filesystem provides an indirection. For example, on Unix,
a Racket installation in @filepath{/usr} might reasonably configure
the @defterm{installation} layer's directories to be in
@filepath{/usr/local} with @filepath{/usr} directories included in the
search lists.

To use @exec{racket} with a new @filepath{config.rktd}, you can supply
the @DFlag{config} or @DFlag{G} flag to @exec{racket} or set the
@envvar{PLTCONFIGDIR} environment variable to point to the directory
containing @filepath{config.rktd}. Alternatively, you can create a
@tech{tethered} layer that creates replacement executables like
@exec{racket} that are hardwired to the layer's configuration
directory.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "tethered-install"]{Tethered Installations}

A @deftech{tethered} installation of Racket is a layer (see
@secref["layered-install"]) that includes a wrapper executable for
every executable across the installation's layers. Each wrapper
executable points back to the new layer's @filepath{config.rktd} (see
@secref["config-file"]) without the use of a @envvar{PLTCONFIGDIR}
environment variable or @DFlag{config} flag. In other words, a
tethered installation provides executables such as @exec{racket},
@exec{raco}, and @exec{drracket} that are tied to the layer. Tethering
thus helps to create a layer of installation that behaves in a more
self-contained way, but with minimal duplication of the underlying
layers.

Tethering works at either a @defterm{user} or @defterm{installation}
layer:

@itemlist[

 @item{A @defterm{user} layer with tethering is represented by a fresh
       directory @nonterm{addon-dir} and a

       @racket['addon-tethered-console-bin-dir] to
       @nonterm{tethered-bin-dir},
       @racket['addon-tethered-gui-bin-dir] to
       @nonterm{tethered-gui-bin-dir}, and (optionally)
       @racket['addon-tethered-apps-dir] to
       @nonterm{tethered-apps-dir}. Initialize the tethered layer
       with

       @commandline{racket -A @nonterm{addon-dir} -l- raco setup --avoid-main}}

 @item{An @defterm{installation} layer with tethering is like a one

       directories, but executables are not specifically created there by
       @exec{raco setup}. Initialize the tethered layer with

       @commandline{racket -G @nonterm{layer-dir}/etc -l- raco setup}}

]

In either case, initialization creates tethered executables in the
directories @nonterm{tethered-bin-dir} and
@nonterm{tethered-gui-bin-dir}, writing @filepath{.desktop} files
(for Unix) in @nonterm{tethered-apps-dir} (if specified). Thereafter, tethered executables like
@exec{@nonterm{tethered-bin-dir}/racket} and
@exec{@nonterm{tethered-bin-dir}/raco} can be used to work with the
tethered layer.
