@declare-exporting[compiler/demodularizer/main]

The @exec{raco demodularize} command (usually used with the shorthand
@exec{raco demod}) takes a Racket module and flattens its
dependencies into a single compiled module, potentially with submodules. A file
@filepath{@nonterm{name}.rkt} is demodularized into
@filepath{@nonterm{name}_rkt_merged.zo}.

See @racketmodname[compiler/demod] for an alternative way to use the
demodularizer. Using @racket[@#,hash-lang[] @#,racketmodname[compiler/demod]]
can cooperate with tools like @seclink["make"]{@exec{raco make}} and
@seclink["setup"]{@exec{raco setup}}, which is especially important
for library modules (as opposed to end-user programs).

In its default configuration, @exec{raco demod} supports flattening a
module that represents an end-user program, so it discards all
syntax and compile-time support in the module and its
dependencies. Submodules are preserved, but their syntax
and compile-time support are similarly discarded. The
demodularized @filepath{.zo} file can be run by passing it as an
argument to the @exec{racket} command-line program, or it can be
turned into an executable with @seclink["exe"]{@exec{raco exe}}.

Supply the @Flag{s} or @DFlag{syntax} flag to preserve syntax
and compile-time components of the module, so that it can be
@racket[require]d the same as the original module. In that case,
modules whose instances need to be shared with other libraries should
be omitted from the demodularization using @Flag{x} or
@DFlag{exclude-library}. For example, @exec{-x racket/base} is
normally needed.

A large single module generated by the demodularizer is compiled as if
@racket[(#%declare #:unlimited-compile)] is specified, so the value of
the @envvar{PLT_CS_COMPILE_LIMIT} environment variable does not limit
compilation of the module.

The @exec{raco demod} command accepts these flags:

@itemlist[

 @item{@Flag{o} @nonterm{file} --- writes the flattened module to
       @nonterm{file} instead of
       @filepath{@nonterm{name}_@nonterm{ext}_merged.zo} for an input
       file @filepath{@nonterm{name}.@nonterm{ext}}.}

 @item{@Flag{x} @nonterm{module-path} or @DFlag{exclude-library} @nonterm{module-path} ---
       excludes the module in @nonterm{module-path} from flattening, as well
       as all of its dependencies. An error is reported if @nonterm{module-path}
       is not a dependency of the input module and has no submodules that are
       dependencies.}

 @item{@Flag{e} @nonterm{path} or @DFlag{exclude-module} @nonterm{path} ---
       excludes the module in relative-file @nonterm{path} from flattening, as well
       as all of its dependencies. An error is reported if @nonterm{path}
       is not a dependency of the input module and has no submodules that are
       dependencies. For backward compatibility, @DFlag{exclude-modules}
       is an alias for @DFlag{exclude-module}.}

 @item{@Flag{s} or @DFlag{syntax} --- preserve syntax objects
       and phase levels greater than the run-time phase in
       the flattened result. Otherwise, only the run-time phase is
       preserved, and unused (or merely exported) definitions are
       pruned, since they cannot be referenced through syntax.}

 @item{@Flag{M} or @DFlag{compile-any} --- flattens the module to
       machine-independent form, instead of recompiling the flattened
       module to the current platform and Racket virtual machine; the
       output generated with @Flag{M} loads more slowly than a
       machine-specific form, but @seclink["decompile"]{@exec{raco
       decompile}} can show the flattened module in a format that is
       closer to source. See also @DFlag{dump-mi}.}

 @item{@Flag{r} or @DFlag{recompile} --- (re)compiles the module to
        machine-dependent form after flattening; this mode is the
        default.}

 @item{@DFlag{work} @nonterm{dir} --- uses @nonterm{dir} to cache
       compiled modules in an intermediate form for flattening; using
       @DFlag{work} with the same @nonterm{dir} for multiple uses of
       @exec{raco demod} can greatly speed up demodularization, and
       since the cache is based on @exec{raco make}, it works even
       with different input files or when modules to be flattened have
       changed since the last use of the cache.}

 @item{@Flag{g} or @DFlag{prune-definitions} --- increases pruning of
       definitions that are unreferenced on the unsound assumption
       that the right-hand side of a definition has no side effect.
       When syntax is preserved, a definition can be pruned as long as
       no syntax literal includes an identifier that is bound to the
       definition. Since these assumptions are unchecked, conversion
       may not preserve the behavior of the input module. For backward
       compatibility, @DFlag{garbage-collect} is an alias for
       @DFlag{prune-definitions}.}

 @item{@DFlag{dump} @nonterm{file} --- writes an S-expression
       representation of the module's content to @nonterm{file}, which
       can be helpful for understanding the content that is in the
       compiled flatten module.}

 @item{@DFlag{dump-mi} @nonterm{file} --- writes a machine-independent
       form of the flattened module to @nonterm{file}, the same as
       @Flag{M} would write, but useful when @Flag{M} is not used.}

]

In addition to preserving submodules or of the source module,
demodularization may introduce new submodules to hold portions of the
flattening. The introduced submodules have names
@racketidfont{demod-pane-} followed by an integer.

@section[#:tag "lib-demod"]{Demodularizing Libraries}

Demodularization of a library module with
@racketmodname[compiler/demod] can create a module whose meaning is
different than the original, since transitive dependencies (that are
not specified as excluded) are copied into the flattened module. That
copying can break sharing as needed for generated structure types or
bindings. As a specific example, separate copies of
@racketmodname[racket/base] will have distinct and incompatible
implementations of keyword arguments for procedures.

To avoid problems, a good general strategy for flattening is

@itemlist[

 @item{put all modules to be flattened into an
        @filepath{private/amalgam} subcollection of, where modules
        within @filepath{private/amalgam} can freely refer to each
        other;}

 @item{create a module @filepath{private/amalgam-src.rkt} that
       requires modules from @filepath{private/amalgam} that need to
       be accessible from outside, where submodules in
       @filepath{private/amalgam-src.rkt} can provided different
       subsets of bindings from @filepath{private/amalgam};}

 @item{create a module @filepath{mine/private/amalgam.rkt} as

       @racketmod[
         @#,racketmodname[compiler/demod]
         "amalgam-src.rkt"
         #:include (#:dir "amalgam")
       ]

       and}

 @item{from outside @filepath{private/amalgam}, use only
       @filepath{private/amalgam.rkt}, perhaps via public modules that
       reprovide from @filepath{private/amalgam.rkt}.}

@section[#:tag "lang-demod"]{Language for Demodularizing}

@defmodulelang[compiler/demod]

A module using @racketmodname[compiler/demod] language compiles to a
form that is the flattened (in the same sense as
@seclink["demod"]{@exec{raco demod}}) version of a source module. See
also @secref["lib-demod"].

A @racket[@#,hash-lang[] @#,racketmodname[compiler/demod]] module body
starts with a @racket[_module-path] to flatten, it may be followed by
options:

@defsubform[#:link-target? #f
            #:id module-begin
            (code:line module-path
                       option
                       ...)
            #:grammar ([option mode
                               (code:line #:include (mod-spec ...))
                               (code:line #:exclude (mod-spec ...))
                               (code:line #:submodule-include (submod-spec ...))
                               (code:line #:submodule-exclude (submod-spec ...))
                               #:prune-definitions
                               (code:line #:dump file)
                               (code:line #:dump-mi file)
                               #:no-demod]
                       [mode #:exe
                             #:dynamic
                             #:static]
                       [mod-spec (code:line #:module module-path)
                                 (code:line #:dir dir-path)
                                 (code:line #:collect collect-name)]
                       [submod-spec identifier
                                    (identifier ...)])]

The default @racket[_mode] is @racket[#:dynamic], which preserves
syntax objects and compile-time support (like macros), but does not
insist that all modules are copied into the flattened module. For
example, if a module is referenced by a combination of submodules
within @racket[_module-path] and no other module is reached by the
same combination, then the benefit of copying the module into a
submodule is limited. The @racket[#:static] mode is like
@racket[#:dynamic], but it ensures that all modules are included
unless they are specified as excluded. The @racket[#:exe] mode
discards syntax and compile-time support, so it may be suitable for
flattening a module that implements an end-user program.

When the @racket[#:include] option is specified, then only modules
covered by a @racket[_mod-spec] will be included in the flattened
form; otherwise, all modules are candidates for inclusion. When the
@racket[#:exclude] option is specified, the modules covered by the
@racket[_mod-spec]s are excluded, even if they would otherwise be
included according to a @racket[#:include] specification. In other
words, @racket[#:exclude] is applied after @racket[#:include].
Each @racket[_mod-spec] must name a module by a filesystem or
collection-based path, and it must not name a submodule; any submodule
of the named module is implicitly included or excluded.
If a @racket[_mod-spec] in the @racket[#:include] or @racket[#:exclude]
list is not a dependency of @racket[module-path] (and has no submodules
that are dependencies), then an exception is raised.

The @racket[#:submodule-include] and @racket[#:submodule-exclude]
specifications are analogous to @racket[#:include] and
@racket[#:exclude], but for submodules immediately with
@racket[_module-path]. If @racket[_mode] is @racket[#:exe], then the
list of inclusions defaults to @racketidfont{main} and
@racketidfont{configure-runtime}, otherwise the default is to have no
specific inclusions.

A @racket[_mod-spec] either indicates a specific module with
@racket[#:module] or it indicates all modules in a given collection
(and its subcollections) with @racket[#:collect]. A
@racket[_collect-name] is always a string with @litchar{/}-separated
components.

If the @racket[#:prune-definitions] option is specified, then unused
definitions from the original module and its dependencies are more
aggressively pruned, but unsoundly. When syntax is preserved for
@racket[#:dynamic] or @racket[#:static] mode, then all definitions are
normally preserved from the original module, because they might be
reachable via @racket[datum->syntax]; when
@racket[#:prune-definitions] is specified, a definition can be pruned
if no syntax object literal includes an identifier bound to the
definition. Meanwhile, in all modes including @racket[#:exe], a
definition is normally preserved if its right-hand side might have a
side effect, but @racket[#:prune-definitions] allows pruning on the
unchecked assumption that a definition has no side effect. Due to its
unchecked assumptions, @racket[#:prune-definitions] may not preserve
the behavior of the input module. @margin-note*{As an example of where
@racket[#:prune-definitions] can go wrong, a module could export a
macro that expands to a use of @racket[syntax-parse], and that use
could include a @litchar{:} shorthand to combine a pattern variable
and a syntax class (also defined in the module) as one identifier. The
identifier would be split into variable and syntax-class components
only when the macro is used, so the shorthand does not count as a
literal that is bound to the syntax class. In that particular
situation, use @racket[~var] instead of the shorthand, and then the
syntax class is referenced by its own identifier. Meanwhile, a macro
that is not exported (directly or indirectly through another macro)
can safely use the @litchar{:} shorthand, since its expansions are
part of the module's implementation.}

If the @racket[#:no-demod] option is specified, then
@racket[_mod-spec] is not flattened, after all. Instead, the new
module @racket[require]s and re@racket[provide]s @racket[_mod-spec]
and each of its submodules. This mode is always used when a
@racketmodname[compiler/demod] module is expanded, since expansion
must produce syntax instead of a compiled module. This mode also may
be useful during for development to avoid longer compile times from
flattening or to check whether copying of modules for flattening
creates any trouble.

A flattened module using @racketmodname[compiler/demod] has a build
dependency on the original module, so a tool like
@seclink["make"]{@exec{raco make}} or @seclink["setup"]{@exec{raco
setup}} will trigger reflattening if the source module changes, but
the flattened module does not have a run-time or expand-time
dependency on the original module. Modules excluded from the
flattening via @racket[#:include] and @racket[#:exclude] remain as
run-time and expand-time dependencies of the flattened module. In the
default @racket[#:dynamic] mode, additional dependencies may be
preserved for modules that cannot be usefully merged, but
@racket[#:static] or @racket[#:exe] mode copies even those modules
into new submodules.

Compilation and expansion of a @racketmodname[compiler/demod] module
creates a @filepath{compiled/demod} subdirectory in the same directory
as the module. That subdirectory that holds freshly compiled versions
of all dependencies of the flattened module in a form that is suitable
for demodularization. This extra compilation is managed using
@racketmodname[compiler/cm], so changes to dependencies can be handled
incrementally, but still separate from normal compilation of the
dependencies.
