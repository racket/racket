v6.1

  * changed the semantics for _!_ variables when they are under
    ellipses, making them less insane. There is now a much simpler
    description of how these two interact (in the docs)
    
  * improved the performance of term generation from judgment-forms
    (when using the #:satisfying keyword argument)

  * lots of improvements to the enumeration test case generator

  * metafunctions can now typeset their contracts

  * added #:equiv option to test-equal

  * added default-equiv

  * added the #:enum-p keyword
    (based on statistics help from Neil Toronto)

  * change the default strategy of redex-check to do enumeration first,
    then interleave random generation and enumeration and then just
    do random generation

v6.0

  * Added an enumerator for patterns. For example, here's how to get
    the first 100 untyped LC terms (over 3 variables) and the 10^10000-th:

        #lang racket
        (require redex)
        
        (define-language L
          (e (e e) x (λ (x) e))
          (x a b c))
        
        (for/list ([i (in-range 100)])
          (generate-term L e #:i-th i))

        (generate-term L e #:i-th (expt 10 10000))

    Thanks to Max New for the enumerator.

  * More patterns that match no terms are now syntax errors, e.g.:
    (any_1 ..._!_1 any_2 ..._!_1 (any_1 any_2) ...)
 
  * added where-make-prefix-pict and where-combine parameters.

  * added #:keep-going to redex-check

  * added #:satisfying to redex-check

  * added #:reduce argument to traces

  * DrRacket's Check Syntax now works better with Redex pattern variables

  * The pattern _ now matches anything but does not bind a variable

  * bug fixes

v5.3.4

  * adjusted define-union-language to allow the unioned languages to
    have overlapping non-terminals; in that case the productions are
    combined

  * Adjust check-metafunction and check-reduction-relation so that
    they skip over randomly generated terms that don't match the
    contract spec (or #:domain spec). This means that when there is a
    case in the metafunction (or reduction-relation) whose nominal
    pattern is more general than the contract would allow, that those
    terms are discarded instead of used as inputs to the predicate.

  * Added the #:pre keyword to define-metafunction. It allows
    contracts that have to relate different arguments to a
    metafunction.

  * Fixed the way random generation for define-judgment-form works so
    that it properly handles metafunctions (i.e., it properly takes
    into account that previous patterns in a metafunction must not
    match when generating a particular clause)


v5.3.3

No changes

v5.3.2

  * added random-generation based on define-judgment-form
    (which allows Redex to more effectively generate things
     like well-typed terms)

  * removed the restriction on unquotes in define-judgment-form

  * added the option to use judgment-forms with only I mode
    positions in terms

  * added 'boolean' as a new pattern

v5.3.1

  * added optional #:lang keyword to term

  * added the ability to name clauses to define-judgment-form

  * added judgment-form-cases

  * adjust define-judgment-form typesetting so that it uses
    the line breaks in a premise to determine how to line
    break the typeset version

v5.3

  * added the amb tutorial.

  * added define-union-language

  * added define-extended-judgment-form

  * extended render-* functions so they can produce PDF

v5.2.1

  * rewrote the internals of the pattern matcher to be more consistent
    (centralized more error checking, moving more of it to compile
    time, and various other internal cleanups).

  * improved the way caching works so it uses about 1/5th memory and
    speeds up the R6RS test suite by about a factor of 2.

  * added a number of optimizations to the pattern matcher that
    speed up the R6RS test suite by 50% or so and speed up a
    lambdaJS benchmark by about a factor of 25.

  * added support for side-conditions and where clauses to
    define-relation, also added support for side-conditions to
    define-judgment-form

  * added the List-machine benchmark (by Appel, Dockins & Leroy)

v5.2

  * added define-judgment-form form

  * added define-term form

  * added with-compound-rewriters form

  * added Ariola-Felleisen by-need evaluation contexts to examples

    on the result of apply-reduction-relation

  * extended render-reduction-relation-rules to accept rule indices
    in addition to rule names

  * added the to-lw/stx procedure

  * fixed domain checking for unioned reduction relations

  * added the #:cache-all? argument to apply-reduction-relation*
    and the current-cache-all? parameter

  * added the #:source argument to generate-term

  * changed redex-match to hide bindings for named ellipses such
    as ..._x

  * fixed misc. bugs in examples and typos in documentation

v5.1.1

  * changed pattern language to disallow unquote

  * fixed matching of ..._x and ..._!_x within ellipses

  * fixed bugs in stepper's diff highlighting

  * improved rendering of arrows in typesetting

  * added support for unioned metafunction codomains

  * fixed typesetting of the pattern (hole p_0 p_1 ...)

  * added arrow->pict, which shows how reduction relation are rendered
    in typesetting

  * added a parameter that provides the default for redex-check's
    #:attempts argument

  * changed the random term generator to produce shorter sequences

  * added a Redex model of the system in Jay McCarthy's ICFP '09 paper
    "Automatically RESTful Web Applications Or, Marking Modular
    Serializable Continuations" to the examples directory

  * resolved PRs 10665, 11174, 11579, 11041, 10837, and 11853

v5.1

  * adds an optional #:pred keyword argument to `test-->>' form

  * added the `redex-pseudo-random-generator' parameter

  * added option `::=' syntax to non-terminal definitions

  * added contract support to `define-relation'

  * added the `test-->∃' form

  * fixed minor bugs

  * added `pretty-print-parameters' to control term pretty-printing

  * added `grammar-style' and `paren-style' typesetting parameters

  * added support for computed reduction rule names

  * added delimited control model to examples

  * added optional #:attempt-size and #:prepare keyword arguments to random 
    testing forms

  * fixed minor bugs

v5.0.1

  * changed the matching of `where' clauses in a
    backwards-incompatible way. Previously, pattern variables bound by
    a `where' left-hand side shadowed bindings from earlier clauses
    and the case's left-hand side; now, `where' clauses match only
    when their bindings match the existing ones. 

  * fixed minor bugs

v5.0

  * added an optional term-equivalence predicate to the test--> and
    test-->> forms

  * added R6RS and Racket VM models to examples sub-collection

    appear in typeset definitions

  * added support for `where' and `side-condition' clauses that do not
    appear in the metafunction's typeset definition

    or returns its result

  * renamed the #:attempts keyword to #:attempt-num in the `generate-term' form

  * changed typesetting to render `where' clauses as `fresh' clauses
    when the right-hand side is a call to `variable-not-in' or 
    `variables-not-in'

  * changed typesetting of meta-variables to render anything following
    a caret (^) as a superscript

  * minor bug fixes

v4.2.4

  * minor bug fixes

v4.2.3

  * added support for collecting metafunction coverage, using the
    'relation-coverage' parameter. This includes a backwards
    incompatible change: the parameter's value is now a list of
    coverage structures, to allow coverage collection for multiple 
    metafunctions and reduction relations at once.

  * redex/reduction-semantics exports the names `hole' and `in-hole'
    (and `term' no longer captures those names).

  * minor bug fixes

v4.2.2

  * minor bug fixes

v4.2.1

  * improved 'where' conditions in metafunctions and
    reduction-relations so that they work with Redex's full pattern
    language. 

    This is a backwards incompatible change. In old versions,
    variables used in a where clause were independent of the pattern
    language. Now, if the variable in a where clause is a literal in
    the grammar, the result of the where clause must be that
    literal. Similarly, if the variable is a non-terminal, the result
    must match that non-terminal.

  * added 'define-relation' 

  * relaxed the restrictions on metafunctions so that multiple
    pattern matches are allowed, as long as the right-hand side
    has the same value for each different pattern binding

  * added metafunction styles 'up-down/compact-side-conditions,
    'left-right/compact-side-conditions, and 
    'left-right/beside-side-conditions.

  * added #:x-spacing and #:y-spacing parameters to traces and
    traces/ps

  * changed the grammar for 'side-condition' clauses
    from (side-condition scheme-expression ... )
    to (side-condition scheme-expression)

v4.2

  * minor bug fixes

v4.1.5

  * renamed test--> to test-->>

  * added a new test--> that only tests for a single step in the
    reduction sequence

  * added #:cycles-ok flag to (what is now called) test-->>

  * define-metafunction and reduction-relation now work better with
    Check Syntax
    
  * added the #:arrow keyword to reduction-relation, which lets you use
    a different main arrow (mostly useful for the typesetting)

  * added domain specifications to reduction relations via
    the #:domain keyword

  * 'traces' copes better with errors during reduction 

  * initial-char-width now accepts functions to give finer grained
    control of the initial widths of the terms.

  * traces & traces/ps: added the ability to specify a mixin
    to be mixed into the graph pasteboard

  * added built-in patterns natural, integer, and real
  
v4.1.4

  * added redex-check, a tool for automatically generating test cases
    for Redex specifications.

  * improved traces for use in generating PostScript:

    - added traces/ps

    - added more coloring arguments to traces: #:scheme-colors? 
    #:default-arrow-highlight-color, and #:default-arrow-color

    - added the #:layout argument to traces 

    - added term-node-set-position! and related term-node functions

  * Added tracing to metafunctions (see current-traced-metafunctions)

  * added caching-enabled? parameter (changed how set-cache-size! 
    works)

v4.1.2

  - added white-bracket-sizing to control how the brackets
    are typeset when rendering a metafunction.

  - added render-* functions that make it easier to experiment
    with typesetting at the REPL.

  - where clauses in metafunctions now are implicitly in
    `term's (they were not documented at all before)

v4.1 (this is the first version that was included in the PLT
      distribution. Before this, Redex was in PLaneT).

  EXTENSIONS:

  - added test-equal, test-pred, test-reduces, and test-results

  - removed restriction on apply-reduction-relation*
    replaced it with additional work while matching
    non-terminals to remove the redundancy

  - added `in-domain?'

  CHANGES:

  - define-metafunction and co. now use a different syntax.

  - got rid of named holes. This means, eg, that (hole #f) now matches
    a two element list, not just the hole directly.

  - zero occurrences of a hole when matching an `in-hole' now
    correctly fails.

  - the `where' keyword in reduction-relation became `with' (and the
    arguments reversed order)

  - renamed the `rib' struct to `bind' (and mismatch-rib =>
    mismatch-bind)

  - merged the various traces functions into a single
    function that accepts keyword arguments.

  - renamed the loc-wrapper struct to lw.

  - language->ps and language->pict's listof-symbols is now
    optional and thus the language->ps's arguments changed
    order to make that work.

  - renamed test-match to redex-match

  - no long export mtch struct or bindings struct and
    test-match's result is not simplified.

  - extend-reduction-relation now uses the names of the
    rules to replace existing rules (instead of just
    unioning the rules)

  - in-hole used to substitute into named holes, but now it
    only substitutes into unnamed holes. Use in-named-hole
    on the right-hand side to do the substitution

  - removed hole-here

  BUG FIXES:

  - fixed a (not easily noticed) bug in the way hole
    matching worked for named holes.

  - extending a non-terminal that's been defined together
    with other non-terminals now works as expected.

  - handling of non-terminals uses that have underscores in
    them now works properly (only showed up when using them
    in the definition of a language)

  - an extended language can now define multiple non-terminals
    together

("robby" "redex.plt" 3 12)

  - Added pict and .ps generation functions for

    are still primitive; the most obvious missing feature is
    the inability (without secret knowledge) to replace the
    pink stuff.

("robby" "redex.plt" 3 0)

precise set of removals and additions:

  - added extend-language
  - added reduction-rule & apply-reduction-relation
  - added union-reduction-relations
  - added define-language

  - changed compatible-closure & context-closure so that the
    pattern argument is not quoted, but is just the pattern
    in the last argument.

  - changed term-node-labels so that it can return #f (in
    the list) when a reduction doesn't have a label.

  - removed language->predicate, compile-pattern,
    match-pattern (use test-match instead)

  - removed reduction, reduction/name, reduction/context,
    reduction/context/name (use reduction-relation instead)

  - removed reduce/tag-with-reduction (use
    apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names instead)

  - removed red-name, reduction->name, give-name

  - removed language (use define-language instead)

  - removed helper.ss

Other improvements:

  - check syntax draws arrows for the non-terminals in a
    `language' now, both to the language and to the
    reduction rules.

("robby" "redex.plt" 2 6)

  - added reduce-all and note about bad parsing performance
    issues.

  - fixed bugs in compatible-closure & context-closure

("robby" "redex.plt" 2 4) 

  - reduced the amount of memory used for caching
    significantly (with some small speedup for 
    a largeish reduction semantics test suite)

  - added set-cache-size!

  - added variable-prefix pattern

  - added ..._<id> pattern that can be used to ensure matching
    lengths of repeated patterns.

  - added _!_ subscripts (both in ... and regular) to ensure
    that the matched things are different (or have different
    lengths in the case of ..._!_ subscripts)

("robby" "redex.plt" 2 3) 

  - added the ability to traverse the graph generated by
    traces in order to decide if a term should be
    highlighted in red. See the traces/pred documentation
    for details.
