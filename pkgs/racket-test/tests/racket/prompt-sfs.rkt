This test is designed to to check whether meta-continuations are
correctly split when a continuation is delimited in the middle of
a meta-continuation other than the current one. In particular,
the `x' binding is part of the deeper meta-continuation when `ak'
is captured, but it is delimited inside the binding, so `x'
should not be reated in `ak'.

The test is implemented using `dump-memory-stats' in another racket
process.
