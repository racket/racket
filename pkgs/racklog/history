%assert documentation bugfix.  From Steve Pothier.

3h4

15 Jul 2001

Added optional Occurs Check, suggested by Brad Lucier.
Brad also points out that the examples/houses.scm
puzzle, as written, needs the Occurs Check.  ("as
written"...?  Well, Prolog doesn't have the Occurs
Check, and this famous puzzle is offered as an exercise
in the Prolog textbook _The Art of Prolog_ (Sterling &
Shapiro).  So I'm thinking perhaps there is a
less naive solution that doesn't rely on the Occurs
Check.)
