Racket v5.3.2

Core Libraries:

* The new `math' library provides functions and data structures for
  working with numbers and collections of numbers.  Functions include
  non-elementary (such as gamma, zeta, Lambert's W), number-theoretic
  (factorization, modular arithmetic), linear algebra (arithmetic,
  decompositions), and statistical (expected values, order statistics,
  binning).  Data structures include arbitrary-precision bigfloats,
  probability distributions, and multidimensional arrays.

* The new `file/untar', `file/untgz', and `file/unzip' libraries support
  unpacking widely used archive formats.

* The new `lazy-require' form allows programs to delay the loading and
  instantiation of helper modules until they are needed.

* The new `data/bit-vector' library provides an implementation of bit
  vectors (a mutable sequence of booleans) supporting popcount.

* The `racket/generic' library allows the specification of default
  method implementations for core datatypes.

* The `openssl' library can verify hostnames and use the operating
  system's certificate store to verify certificates.

Package System:

* A new package system is in beta release.  This system will become
  Planet's successor.  It differs significantly from the latter.  For
  details, please read the documentation at
  http://docs.racket-lang.org/planet2/ and list your packages on the new
  index at https://pkg.racket-lang.org/.

* The `raco test' command supports testing by collection and package, in
  addition to by directory and file, with the "-c" and "-p" options.

Teaching Libraries:

* batch-io: the read and write functions work on Unix-style standard
  input and output.

DrRacket:

* DrRacket's GUI is more responsive.

* The automatic parenthesis insertion mode is improved.

Scribble:

* Scribble renders Markdown format files via the "--markdown"
  command-line flag.  Example use case: Generate documentation hosted on
  GitHub or BitBucket.

* Documentation cross-reference information is stored in an SQLite3
  database, which means that SQLite3 is required for building Racket
  documentation on Unix/Linux machines (but SQLite3 is included in
  Racket distributions for Windows and Mac OS X).

  Using a database for cross-reference information significantly reduces
  the initial footprint of DrRacket, since DrRacket no longer needs to
  load all cross-reference information.

Typed Racket:

* Typed Racket programs can require `plot/typed' to draw plots.  List-
  and vector-accepting functions accept general sequences.

* Typed Racket supports Racket's delimited continuation and continuation
  mark operators.

Redex:

* Added more support for `define-judgment-form', including random
  generation for well-formed judgments and visualization of judgments.

Deprecation:

The following have been removed in this release:

* the `planet' command-line tool; use `raco planet' instead.

The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the August 2013
release:

* the `mzlib/class100' library; use `racket/class' instead.
