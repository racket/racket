# What Gets Tested
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# These tests run in GitHub Actions, where the environment isn't suited
# to run all the tests. This script tries to run most of the tests that
# can easily run in that environment. The rest of the tests are run by
# DrDr[1] whenever changes are made to the master branch.
#
# [1]: http://drdr.racket-lang.org/


# Collection Tests
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Tests where `raco test` can discover and run all the tests.
