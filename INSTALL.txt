Building Racket
===============

The "racket" directory contains a stripped down version of Racket ---
enough to run `raco pkg' to install everything else.

The "pkgs" directory contains the packages that are included in a
Racket distribution.

On Unix and Mac OS X, you can build Racket plus the included packages
with `make in-place' (or just `make'). The resulting build is in the
"racket" subdirectory.  For now, you need to have `git' installed for
downloading native-library packages. If you want more control over the
process, see below.

On Windows, you must first clone "git://github.com/plt/libs.git"
as "build/native-pkgs". Then, you can use `nmake win32-in-place'.


Building Core Racket
====================

Instead of using the top-level makefile, you can go into "racket/src"
and follow the "README" there, which gives you more configuration
options.

If you don't want any special configuration and you just want the core
build, you can use `make core' (or `nmake win32-core') with the
top-level makefile.


Installing Packages
===================

In the near future, after you've built the core, you can install
packages via a package-catalog server (ignoring the content of
"pkgs"). That catalog server is not ready, yet.


Linking Packages for Development Mode
=====================================

Aside from the issue of native-library packages, using all of the
packages in "pkgs" corresponds to a build that is like the main Racket
distribution. Furthermore, if you install all of those packages with
`raco pkg install -i --link ...', then you can edit libraries or
update via `git pull' plus `raco setup' (as opposed to updating or
reinstalling packages).

The `pkg-links' target of the makefile links (or re-links) packages
from "pkgs" into the "racket" build. (The `in-place' target of the
makefile uses `pkg-links'.) Packages are linked using installation
scope, so that the links affect only the build in the "racket"
directory. Use the `pkg-links' target whenever the set of native
packages or packages in "pkgs" changes. Packages are linked with the
`--no-setup' flag (effectively), which means that a `raco setup' is
needed after installing links.

Native-library packages provide (on Mac OS X and Windows) pre-built
native libraries, such as Cario. Currently, the libraries must be
downloaded from GitHub. On a non-Windows platform, the
`native-from-git' makefile target clones/updates the native-library
reposiroty from GitHub; otherwise, clone

   git://github.com/plt/libs.git

as
 
   build/native-pkgs

When you have a "build/native-pkgs" directory, then the `pkg-links'
makefile target also links relavant native packages.

You need a "racket" build before linking packages. So, to get set up:

 git clone git://github.com/mflatt/racket.git plt
 cd plt
 git checkout pkg

 make core

 # Mac OS X:
 make native-from-git
 # Windows:
 git clone git://github.com/plt/libs.git build/native-pkgs

 make pkg-links
 racket/bin/raco setup


Trying Packages Locally
=======================

Suppose that you've built core "racket" and you want to see what
it looks like to install individual packages.

Use `make local-catalog' to create a package catalog that provides
mappings for all of the packages in "pkgs" as well as packages
pre-built native libraries downloaded from GitHub. (On Unix, use the
`local-source-catalog' makefile target to skip native libraries, since
none are needed.)

To install a package, try

 racket/bin/raco pkg install -i --catalog build/local/catalog --deps search-auto <pkg-name>

The `-i' flag makes the package install specific to the build in the
"racket" directory. The `--catalog build/local/catalog' causes the
installation to use the catalog created by the `local-catalog'
makefile target. The `--deps search-auto' flag installs dependencies
(from the local catalog) automatically.

To remove the package, try

 racket/bin/raco pkg remove -i --auto <pkg-name>

The `--auto' flag undoes automatic installs from `--deps search-auto'.

If you try out packages in this way, clean out all package
installations before trying to create installers (as described in the
next section), because the distribution-bundle process expects a core
build in "racket" that has no installed packages.


Building Installers
===================

To build distribution installers, do not use `make in-place' or just
`make', but instead start from a clean repository.

Use one non-Windows machine as a server, where packages will be
pre-built. Then, create platform-specific installers on N client
machines, each of which contacts the server machine to obtain
pre-built packages. The server can act as a client, naturally, to
create an installer for the server's platform.

Roughly, the steps are

 1. On the server machine:
      make server PKGS="..."

 2. On each client machine:
      make client SERVER=... PKGS="..."
    or
      nmake win32-client SERVER=... PKGS="..."

    Add `RELEASE_MODE=--release' to the `client' line to build
    a "release" installer, as opposed to a snapshot installer.

In more detail:

 1a. Build "racket" on a server.
    
     The `core' target of the makefile will do that, if you haven't
     done it already. On Windows, use `nmake win32-core'.

 1b. On the server, build packages and start a catalog server.

     The `server-from-core' target of the makefile will do that. (The
     server only works on non-Windows platforms, currently.)

     Alternatively, use the `server' target, which combines `core' and
     `server-from-core' (i.e., steps 1a and 1b).

     The `PKGS' variable of the makefile determines which packages are
     built for potential inclusion in a distribution.

     The `SRC_CATALOG' variable determines the catalog that is used to
     get package sources and native-library packages, but a value of
     "local" triggers a bootstrap mode where native libraries are
     downloaded directly from GitHub and all other packages are
     represented by directories in the makefile's directory. For now,
     "local" is the default.

     If you stop the server and want to restart it, use the
     `built-package-server' makefile target instead of starting over
     with the `server' target.

 2a. On each client (one for each platform to bundle), build "racket".

     This is the same as step 1, but on each client. If the client and
     server are the same, there's nothing more to do for step 3.

 2b. On each client, create an installer.

     The `client' (or `win32-client') target of the makefile will do
     that. Provide `SERVER' as the hostname of the server machine, and
     provide the same `PKGS' (or a subset) as in step 1b if you want a
     different set than the ones listed in the makefile.

     Alternatively, use the `client' target, which combines `core' and
     `client-from-core' (i.e., steps 2a and 2b).

     To create a release installer, provide `RELEASE_MODE' as
     "--release". A release installer has slightly different defaults
     that are suitable for infrequently updated release installations,
     as opposed to ferquently updated snapshot installations.

     On Windows, you need NSIS installed, either in the usual location
     or with `makensis' in your command-line path.

On each client, step 2b produces a "bundle/installer.txt" file that
contains the path to the generated installer.
