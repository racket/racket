This is the source code for the core of Racket. See "INSTALL.txt" for
full information on building Racket.

To build the full Racket distribution from this repository, run `make`
in the top-level directory. To build minimal Racket, run `make base`.

The rest of the Racket distribution source code is in other
repositories, mostly under [the Racket GitHub
organization](https://github.com/racket).
